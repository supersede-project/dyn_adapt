## Composition Hook Component

- (Composition) Adaptation Hook: The adaptation hook offers a generic interface, embeddable into adaptive systems, that enables the enactment of adaptation actions into the adaptable systems, provided that they adheres to the SUPERSEDE Adaptable System Architecture. This architecture requires supported adaptive systems to expose services that implement the Adaptation Hook API and apply received platform-specific adaptation actions. This component specifically enables the execution of the adaptations of REST-based web services. For that purpose, we use cURL.

See deliverable D4.5 in [Supersede Portal](https://www.supersede.eu/) for more details about this component, how to install and use it.
