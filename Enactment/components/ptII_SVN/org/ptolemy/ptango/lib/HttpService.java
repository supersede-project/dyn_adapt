/** An interface for actors that handle HTTP requests.  The interface
 *  allows the relative path for the HTTP request to be set and obtained,
 *  and provides a servlet to handle requests. If this interface is
 *  implemented by an actor or attribute in a model that contains
 *  an instance of {@link WebServer}, then requests to that server
 *  that match the relative path set by the {@link #setRelativePath(URI)}
 *  method of this interface will be delegated to that actor or attribute.
 *  <p>
 *  Note that "HttpService" is also the name of an OSGi interface.  If OSGi is
 *  incorporated in Ptolemy in the future, we might want to rename this
 *  interface. See
 *  <a href="http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html">/home/hudson/jobs/kepler/workspace/ptolemy/src/com/microstar/xml/demo/XmlApp.java</a>.
