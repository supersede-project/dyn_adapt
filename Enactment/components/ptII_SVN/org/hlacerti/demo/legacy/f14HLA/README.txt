   HLA/CERTI. The co-simulation framework PtolemyII - HLA/CERTI is used for
   this demo.

 - CERTI environment installed on your computer
 - PtolemyII framework installed on your computer

EXECUTION:

 1. Open a terminal, source the script myCERTI_env.sh provided by CERTI
 2. Launch the Eclipse configured for PtolemyII
