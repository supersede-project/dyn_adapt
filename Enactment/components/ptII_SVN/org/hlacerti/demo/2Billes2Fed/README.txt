These files are test models for the improved HLA/Certi cosimulation framework.

This scenario is similar to the one in folder "billiard" but each "bille" (balls)
is a federate (in a different Ptolemly model): Bille.xml and Bille2.xml.

TestDisplay2 is a federate which can display up to 3 instances of billard and it is the
same than in folder "billard".

Open the file 2Billes2Fed.xml and follow the instructions.
For more information, see README in folder "billard".
