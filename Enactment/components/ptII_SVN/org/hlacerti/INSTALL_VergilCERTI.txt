Installation and deployment of VergilCERTI to run a Polemy model as a Ptolemy
Federate in a HLA/CERTI Federation.

Requirements: we assume that you have a
- ptII project correctly installed in an eclipse
- the CERTI environment installed (see INSTALL_CERTI.txt)
- the JCERTI API installed (see INSTALL_JCERTI.txt)


###################################
1) Installation process (summary):

To launch VergilCERTI, we need to set te CERTI environment variables, in Eclipse:
    
	1.	Select onglet 'Run' then 'Run Configurations…'
	2.	Double-click on 'Java Application'
	3.	Complete as the followings:

			Name: vergilCERTI
			Project: ptII
			Main class: ptolemy.vergil.VergilApplication

	4.	Select "Environment" frame and add the following variables by clicking 
		on "New…"
	
			Name: CERTI_HOME
			Value: <path_for_scripts_and_binaries> 

			Name: PATH
			Value: <path_for_scripts_and_binaries>/bin:${env_var:PATH}

			NAME LD_LYBRARY_PATH
			Value: <path_for_scripts_and_binaries>/lib:${env_var:LD_LYBRARY_PATH}

			NAME DYLD_LYBRARY_PATH
			Value: <path_for_scripts_and_binaries>/lib:${env_var:DYLD_LYBRARY_PATH}
			
		Where <path_for_scripts_and_binaries> is the absolute path that you
		have specified when you have installed CERTI (see INSTALL_CERTI.txt
		section 1) - 4.

	5.	Launch vergilCerti and open and run the Ptolemy model
	
NOTE: This configuration is not required if you launch an eclipse or vergil 
from a terminal. In this case, you have just to source the 
<path_for_scripts_and_binaries>/share/script/myCERTI_env.sh environment file
generated by the installation process of CERTI (see INSTALL_CERTI.txt) before
running your eclipse or vergil. The current implementation of the HlaManager
is able to retrieve the environment variables provided by this script.

NOTE2: The HlaManager implementation is also able to launch in background the
RTIG process. But it is always possible to the run the RTIG in a separate
terminal with the required FOM (.fed) file.
