The original version of the HLA/Ptolemy Framework had several files and 
pieces of code to integrate Ptides simulation into the HLA ones.
Most of it was annotated with FIXME comments and was commented out code.

They were removed at revision 72126. If you want to see the work that was done, 
just checkout a version below that one.
