/**
 This director extends FSMDirector by supporting production and consumption
 of multiple tokens on a port in a firing. This director assumes that every
 state has exactly one refinement, unless the state has an immediate
 transition whose guard evaluates to true in the iteration in which the
 state is entered. In addition, preemptive transitions are not allowed.
 Hence, each time when a modal model is fired,
 the current state always has a state refinement that is fired and
 will consume and produce outputs.
 <p>
 The number of tokens to be transferred from an input port of the modal model
 is at most the token consumption rate inferred by the inside port of the
 current state refinement. The number of tokens to be transferred from an
 output port of the state refinement is exactly the token production rate
 inferred by the state refinement. If there are not enough tokens available
 from the refinement, an exception is thrown. The default token consumption
 and production rate of a port is 1.
 <p>
 When a state transition occurs, this director compares the port rates of
 the destination state refinement with that of the current state refinement.
 If the rates are different, then it invalidate the schedule of the executive
 director of the modal model and updates the port rates of the modal model to be
 the port rates of the destination state refinement.
