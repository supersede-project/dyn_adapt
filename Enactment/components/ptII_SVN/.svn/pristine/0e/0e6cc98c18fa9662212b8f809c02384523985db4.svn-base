    <h1>Process Networks</h1>
    <p>
      To model hardware and embedded applications, a highly concurrent model of
      computation is required. The PN domain in Ptolemy II presents a mechanism to
      model concurrency using the Kahn process networks model of computation [1].
      The process networks model of computation has a dataflow flavor to it.
      This makes it well suited to modeling embedded dataflow applications and
      hardware architectures. <p>

    <p>In Ptolemy II, an implementation of the Kahn-MacQueen [2] semantics is
      provided. This is the bounded memory execution as proposed by T. Parks [3].<p>

      The following are the most important features of the operational semantics of
      PN as proposed by Kahn and MacQueen:
      <ul>
	<li>This is a network of sequential processes.</li>
	<li>The processes do not share memory. Instead they communicate with each other
	  only through unidirectional FIFO channels.</li>
	<li>Communication between processes is asynchronous.</li>
	<li>Processes block on a read from a FIFO channel if the channel is empty but
	  can write to a channel whenever they want to.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The above features make the execution of the network deterministic. The
      implementation in Ptolemy II is based on Java threads and synchronizing
      monitors. <p>

    <p>In addition to the above features, the PN domain has been extended to support
      a notion of global time. Time advances for a PN process either when the process
      is blocked on a read from some channel or when  is explicitly waiting for time
      to advance. This is based primarily on Pamela [4].<p>

    <p>PN has been further extended to support dynamic changes to a graph. In case of
      timed-PN these changes are completely deterministic, while in case of
      untimed-PN, the changes could be non-deterministic and can depend on the
      schedule of the underlying java threads. <p>
