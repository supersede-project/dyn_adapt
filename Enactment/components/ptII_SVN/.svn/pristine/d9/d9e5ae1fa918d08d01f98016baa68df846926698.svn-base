/**  A device discovery library for the Javascript Nashorn engine.
 *  
 *  This library uses the "ping" and "arp" commands to discover devices 
 *  connected to the local network.  Command syntax is adjusted for OS 
 *  differences.
 *  
 *  It implements the discover(IPAddress) method required by the device 
 *  discovery accessor, and returns a JSON object containing a list of device
 *  IP addresses, and names and MAC addresses when available.
 *  
 *  Accessors overview: https://www.terraswarm.org/accessors/

/**  A service discovery function for the Javascript Nashorn engine.
 *  
 *  The long term goal is to provide a discovery process based on a defined ontology
 *  for a particular category of services. Right now, the list of services are known a-priori 
 *  and specified as interfaces (e.g. GSNInterface.js) that context aware accessor can  include using the 
 *  'implement' function. 
 *  
 *  The known services are obtained via the services() function which is implemented
 *  by the method availableServices() in the helper class.
