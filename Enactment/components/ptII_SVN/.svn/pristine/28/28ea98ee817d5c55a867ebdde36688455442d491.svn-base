  <h1>Copyright for April</h1>
  <p>The April tags accessor code uses code written by Edwin Olson (ebolson@umich.edu), see
    <a href="https://april.eecs.umich.edu/#in_browser" target="_top">https://april.eecs.umich.edu/</a></p>

  <p>These files are part of a modified subset of the
    april package created by Professor Edward A. Lee (eal@eecs.berkeley.edu) that
    removes all dependencies on external libraries and graphical classes
    and renames the packages to follow Java naming conventions.</p>

  <h2>License</h2>
  <p>Most of April is GPL'd, but we asked for and received a BSD license on the Java april/tag code.</p>

    <p>I am okay with dual-licensing the Java code in april/tag and its necessary dependencies under BSD  clause license. (And since I'm putting this in writing-- this does not extend to other software in the april repository.) The specific license is included below for reference, which includes an additional attribution clause versus the one you sent.</p>

    <p>That said, the java version is so ludicrously outperformed by the C version that I'd really like to convince you to (somehow) use the C version instead. It's not a C-versus-Java thing; the detector logic itself is using completely new algorithms.  It is also *much* cleaner in terms of dependencies.</p>

    <p>Is there some way to make the C version easier to use from Java? I'm no fan of JNI either. Any ideas?</p>
