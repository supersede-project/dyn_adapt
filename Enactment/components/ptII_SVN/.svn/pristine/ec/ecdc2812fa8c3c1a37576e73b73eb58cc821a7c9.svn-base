     * Returns the <code>CompositeEntity</code> providing the requested actor-oriented class definition, if this provider has it.
     * <p>
     * An actor-oriented class can have only a "simple" name, i.e. no dots, as the underlying <code>NamedObj</code> does not allow dot-separated names.
     * However, provider implementations may allow <code>className</code> values with dots.
     * Remark that once loaded in the Ptolemy runtime, all actor-oriented classes are managed by their "simple" name only!
     * So, when using dot-separated "nested" names, the final part must still be unique within the complete runtime!
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * So using hierarchical class names may make sense to support organizing the classes in hierarchical structures for storage and lookup,
     * instead of being limited to simple "linear" lists. But they do not introduce a runtime "name space" like packages do for Java classes.
     * </p>
     * If this provider doesn't have this class available, it should throw a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>.
     * (Optionally, it could also just return null, for those dvp-ers who don't like exceptions. ;-) )
     *
     * @param className Mandatory, not-null.
     * @param versionSpec optional constraint on desired version for the class that must be provided. If null, no version constraint is imposed.
     * @return the actor-oriented class matching the given className
     * @exception ClassNotFoundException if this provider can not provide the requested class for the requested version (if specified)
