/** Issue an HTTP request and provide a callback function for responses.
 *  The callback is a function that is passed an instance of IncomingMessage,
 *  defined here. This function returns an instance of ClientRequest, also defined here.
 *  The HTTP request will not actually be issued until you call the end() function on
 *  the returned ClientRequest.
 *
 *  This implementation ensures that for any accessor that calls this function,
 *  the callback functions are called in the same order as
 *  invocations of this request() function that triggered the request.
 *  If you call this function from the same accessor before the previous
 *  request has been completed (the callback function has been called or it has
 *  timed out), then the request will be queued to be issued only after the previous
 *  request has been satisfied.
 *
 *  The options argument can be a string URL
 *  or a map with the following fields (this helper class assumes
 *  all fields are present, so please be sure they are):
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> body: The request body, if any.  This supports at least strings and image data.
 *  <li> headers: An object containing request headers. By default this
 *       is an empty object. Items may have a value that is an array of values,
 *       for headers with more than one value.
 *  <li> keepAlive: A boolean that specified whether to keep sockets around
 *       in a pool to be used by other requests in the future. This defaults to false.
 *  <li> method: A string specifying the HTTP request method.
 *       This defaults to 'GET', but can also be 'PUT', 'POST', 'DELETE', etc.
 *  <li> outputCompleteResponseOnly: If false, then the multiple invocations of the
 *       callback may be invoked for each request. This defaults to true, in which case
 *       there will be only one invocation of the callback.
 *  <li> timeout: The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for a response
 *       before triggering a null response and an error. This defaults to 5000.
 *  <li> url: A string that can be parsed as a URL, or an object containing
 *       the following fields:
 *       <ul>
 *       <li> host: A string giving the domain name or IP address of
 *            the server to issue the request to. This defaults to 'localhost'.
 *       <li> path: Request path as a string. This defaults to '/'. This can
 *            include a query string, e.g. '/index.html?page=12', or the query
 *            string can be specified as a separate field (see below). 
 *            An exception is thrown if the request path contains illegal characters.
 *       <li> protocol: The protocol. This is a string that defaults to 'http'.
 *       <li> port: Port of remote server. This defaults to 80. 
 *       <li> query: A query string to be appended to the path, such as '?page=12'.
 *       </ul>
 *  </ul>
 *  @param options The options or URL.
 *  @param responseCallback The callback function to call with an instance of IncomingMessage,
 *   or with a null argument to signal an error.
 *  @return An instance of ClientRequest.
 */

// NOTE: Perhaps options should include a localAddress: A string giving a name or 
// IP address for the local network interface to use
// for network connections. This defaults to 'localhost', but on machines with more than one
//  network interface (e.g. WiFi and Ethernet), you may need to specify which one to use.
// Marten, 05/21/2015: I'm not sure if I understand the problem (or solution) here.
// Depending on the IP address, the host's routing table will
// determine which device will be used. The name 'localhost' does not signify a 
// network interface but a hostname.

// NOTE: Node has keepAliveMsecs, but I don't see anything like it in Vert.x
// When using HTTP KeepAlive, this is an integer that specifies
// how often (in milliseconds) to send a TCP KeepAlive packet over sockets being kept alive.
// This defaults 1000 and is only relevant if keepAlive is set to true.

// NOTE: The following options are supported by http.request() in Node.js, but not here,
// or at least not tested (yet):
// hostname: To support url.parse() hostname is preferred over host
// socketPath: Unix Domain Socket (use one of host:port or socketPath)
// auth: Basic authentication i.e. 'user:password' to compute an Authorization header.
// agent: Controls Agent behavior. When an Agent is used request will default to Connection: keep-alive. Possible values:
// undefined (default): use global Agent for this host and port.
// Agent object: explicitly use the passed in Agent.
// false: opts out of connection pooling with an Agent, defaults request to Connection: close.

// NOTE: This interface is attempting to follow principles in this module: 
// https://github.com/request/request
