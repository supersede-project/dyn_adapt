<p>An Eclipse plugin for backtracking source transformation. This plugin supports
Eclipse from version 3.1. To enable the full features, Eclipse 3.2 or higher is
  required.</p>

<p>To transform source code without the plugin, see $PTII/ptolemy/backtrack/automatic/package.html</p>

<p>See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090414182919/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tfeng/plugin.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20090414182919/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tfeng/plugin.html"</a> for notes about how to use the plugin.</p>

<p>Note that as of April, 2016, we were unable to use the plugin, but below are some instructions.</p>

<p>To build the plugin, cd to the <code>build</code> directory and run <code>ant</code>.</p>

<p>Then, copy <code>ptolemy.backtrack_0.1.3.jar</code> to the <code>plugins/</code> directory of Eclipse.  Under Mac OS X, the plugins/ directory might be <code>/Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/</code></p>

<p>Restart Eclipse</p>

<p>In theory, the Ptolemy plugin should show up, but it does not</p>
