 A class that abstracts the notion of a channel that connects two actors.
 It encapsulates the port of the downstream actor and the relation that connects
 the two actors.
 It is used instead of just the input port of the downstream actor in order to
 distinguish input channels that connect to the same multiport.
 It is used instead of the relation that connects the two actors in order
 to distinguish outputs that split to many downstream actors.
 The pair of the upstream output port and the downstream input port could
 be used.
