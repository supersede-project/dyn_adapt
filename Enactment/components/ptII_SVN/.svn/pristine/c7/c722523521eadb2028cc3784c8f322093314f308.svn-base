/**
 * NonBlockingFire is a wrapper for Ptolemy actor. It provides an implementation
 * of FireMachine. More specifically, the wrapper implements a startOrResume()
 * function that associates the state of FireMachine with the state of fire() of
 * the wrapped actor as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>START: initial state</li>
 * <li>FINAL: final state</li>
 * </ol>
 * When startOrResume() is called, if the current state is START, the wrapper
 * calls fire() of the wrapped actor, and transition to FINAL
