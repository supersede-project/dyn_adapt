/**

 This class is a test for the case whre FIFOQueue.clone() does not call super.clone().

  FindBugs reports this as:
  "clone method does not call super.clone()"

  <p>"This non-final class defines a clone() method that does
  not call super.clone(). If this class ("A") is extended by
  a subclass ("B"), and the subclass B calls super.clone(),
  then it is likely that B's clone() method will return an
  object of type A, which violates the standard contract for
  clone()."</p>

  <p>"If all clone() methods call super.clone(), then they are
  guaranteed to use Object.clone(), which always returns an
  object of the correct type."</p>
