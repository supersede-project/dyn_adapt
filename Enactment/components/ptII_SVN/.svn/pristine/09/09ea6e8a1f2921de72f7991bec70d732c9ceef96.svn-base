  <p>This packagecontains the VersionSpecification abstract class and its only currently existing implementation; plus FutureValue: a Future implementation that can be used outside of the JDK ExecutorService.</p> 
  <p>These classes are used as part of the changes to MoMLParser to support OSGi and the
    <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.triquetrum#in_browser" target="_top">Triquetrum project</a>.</p>
