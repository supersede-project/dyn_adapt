Install certi (an open source RTI following the hla standard) latest version.  As of 10/17/15, that was version 3.5.1.
Download the gzipped tar file from:
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/certi/

Here a receipe for installing certi:
   mkdir $HOME/pthla
   cd $HOME/pthla
   tar xvfz CERTI-3.5.1-Source.tar.gz # (or double click to expand)
   mv CERTI-3.5.1-Source certi # (or create a symbolic link: ln -s CERTI-3.5.1-Source certi)
   mkdir $HOME/pthla/certi-tools
   cd $HOME/pthla/certi
   mkdir $HOME/pthla/certi/build-certi
   cd $HOME/pthla/certi/build-certi
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/pthla/certi-tools  ../
   make
   make install

CERTI has been compiled and installed in the ’$HOME/pthla/certi-tools’ folder. CERTI provides a script to set the environment (global variables, binaries, etc) to allow the correct launch of RTIG process, RTIA process and federates. To set the CERTI environment properly in a terminal run the command:

Put the following line in your ~/.bash_profile file:

   source $HOME/pthla/certi-tools/share/scripts/myCERTI_env.sh

To test the installation:

1. open 3 terminals (make sure you open new terminals or source ~/.bash_profile in already open terminals)
2. go to the first terminal and execute the command "rtig"
3. go to second terminal and call a billard federate "1" (-n name)
      billard -n1 -fTest -FTest.fed -t10
   DO NOT HIT ENTER YET.
4. go to the third terminal and call a billard federate "2" (-n name)
      billard -n2 -fTest -FTest.fed -t10
   DO NOT HIT ENTER YET.
5. go back to second terminal (of step 3) and press "ENTER"

The billard demo that has been run is in $HOME/pthla/certi/test/Billard/.


To run the Ptolemy demos, see $PTII/org/hlacerti/demo

################################### FIXME: Old instructions below

Installation and deployment of CERTI

Requirements: we assume that you have a
- recent C++ compiler 
- the CMake tool
- Bison, the GNU version of yacc.
###################################
1) Installation process (summary):

	1.	Get the last CERTI cvs source using the command: 
	
	      cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/sources/certi co certi
	      
	      Note: 2014-12-20, the CVS head was broken,
	      see https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?40977
	      
	      Instead, try:
	      wget http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/certi/CERTI-3.4.3-Source.tar.gz
              tar -zxf CERTI-3.4.3-Source.tar.gz 

	2.	Go to the CERTI cvs folder downloaded
	           cd CERTI-3.4.3-Source
	3.	Create the folder 'build_certi' and go to this folder
	           mkdir build_certi
		   cd build_certi
   	4.	Run cmake:
	           cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path_for_scripts_and_binaries> -DCERTI_USE_NULL_PRIME_MESSAGE_PROTOCOL=ON ../
                For example:
                   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/certi-3.4.3 -DCERTI_USE_NULL_PRIME_MESSAGE_PROTOCOL=ON ../
		All  files required to build CERTI are stored in the 'build_certi' folder.
	5.	Run:
                   make
	6.	Asr root, run
                   make install

Note: In your current terminal, you'll see  information about the (correct) build 
of CERTI and where are stored the different environment scripts used to set the 
CERTI environment.

#############
2) Deployment

For the deployment of an HLA Federation in C++, you need to launch one terminal for running the 'rtig' binary, and one terminal per federate if you have displayed information. To excute the 'rtig' or a federate do this procedure :

	1.	Open a new terminal
	2.	Source the CERTI environment script. This script is stored in the 
	    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set during the installation process 
	    (see previous subsection).
	3.	'source <path_for_scripts_and_binaries>/share/scripts/myCERTI.sh'
	4.	Run 'rtig' or the federate required, for example './<fed-binary>'

####################
3) Debug information

Environment variables used to display traces (e.g. messages) from CERTI :

- 'export RTIG_MSG=D' in RTIG (for messages exchanged between RTIA <--> RTIG)

- 'export RTIA_MSG=D' in a Federate's terminal (for messages exchanges between Federate <--> RTIA)
