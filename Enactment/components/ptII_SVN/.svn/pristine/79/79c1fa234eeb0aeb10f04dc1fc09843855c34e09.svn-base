//// MultiFrameTask

/**
 <p>A multiframe task is an edge-labeled and vertex-labeled directed cyclic graph
 together with a current location predicate. The nodes are annotated with task frames,
 the edges are labeled with minimum separation times, and the current location contains
 a specific node of the graph. A task frame {@link TaskFrame} is represented by an
 execution time and a relative deadline.</p>

 <p>During an execution a multiframe task is at the node specified by current location predicate.
 If it has not released a job since the time it entered the node, it may do so at any time.
 The job's deadline and execution time are as specified by the task frame associated with the
 node. After a job is released at a node, the multiframe task waits for time equal to the
 separation time specified by the outgoing edge (there is a unique outgoing edge, since it is
 a cyclic graph) and then moves the current location to the node downstream.</p>

 <p>The minimum separation time of an edge, that connects two nodes A and B, describes then
 the minimum time that can separate a release of a job from node B from a release of a job
 from node A. This class simulates the case where the separation time is always equal to the
 minimum value.</p>

 <p>For more information on multiframe tasks and the schedulability problem of such tasks look
 at: Sanjoy Baruah, Deji Chen, Sergey Gorinsky, and Aloysius Mok (1999).
