        // Unfortunately, how architectures are specified under Java
        // is a bit messed up.

        //  Under Darwin, the os.arch property is ok, it is set to
        //  x86_64

        //  The os.name property is set to "Mac OS X", which is not a
        //  good directory name.

        //  We could use the ptolemy.ptII.jni.architecture property,
        //  which is set by configure, but configure is not always
        //  run.

        //  So, why don't we use the name "auto/os.name-os.arch/"
        //  where os.name is the value of the os.name property
        //  downcased and with spaces removed and the os.arch is the
        //  value of os.arch.

        // Thus, for RHEL, we would use auto/linux-amd64/

        // For Darwin: auto/macosx-x86_64/

        // An alternative would be to use the fmi architecture names
        // like linux64 and darwin64, but these names do not have much
        // to do with Java and I'm guessing are going to change.

        //  One problem is that RHEL has an old version of GLIBC,
        //  which means that recent Ubuntu fmu binaries will not run
        //  on the nightly build machine. The workaround for this is
        //  to build the fmus on the nightly build machine. Upgrading
        //  the nightly build machine to Ubuntu is out of scope.

        // The FMI standard should have used with the GNU triplet
        // architecture names or the Debian multiarch names
        // (https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Tuples)

        // So, linux64 is not sufficient to differentiate between RHEL
        // and Ubuntu. A better version number would include the
        // version of GLIBC.
