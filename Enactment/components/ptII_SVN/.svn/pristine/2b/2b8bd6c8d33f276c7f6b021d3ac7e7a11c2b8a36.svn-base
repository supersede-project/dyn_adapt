<h1>License for Energy Plus</h1>
<p>
The EPlusActuator demo uses weather data files from Energy Plus, 
USA-IL-Chicago-OHare.Intl.AP.725300_TMY3.*.  Energy Plus
is available under a custom open source license modeled after the Mozilla 
Public License, according to 
<a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_licensing.cfm#in_browser" target="_top">
EnergyPlus Licensing </a> on June 7, 2013.
</p>

<p>
The EnergyPlus license requires that the source code to any modified EnergyPlus
files be made available.  None of the EnergyPlus files included with Ptolemy
were modified.

<blockquote>
<ul> 
<li>
Open source license. For the first time, EnergyPlus is available under a true 
open-source license. Under this license, which is modeled after the Mozilla 
Public License (MPL), you may obtain EnergyPlus source code, modify it, combine 
it with other software that is licensed under different terms, distribute it, 
and re-license it. The license is "weak copyleft" in that it covers only 
EnergyPlus and its modifications going forward. Code that is combined with 
EnergyPlus is not affected. This license requires that you distribute the source 
code for EnergyPlus modifications and that you refer to the EnergyPlus component 
of your distribution as "a modified version of EnergyPlus vX." You may remove 
the "modified" designation by obtaining prior written permission from Berkeley 
Lab. As with any open source license, there is no fee.
