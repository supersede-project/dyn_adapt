<h1>License for ProtoBuf</h1>
<p>The Metro II Ptolemy domain code that uses Google ProtoBuf.</p>

<p>The Google site for <a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/#in_browser">Protocol Buffers</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
"Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data
in an efficient yet extensible format."

<p>On December 10, 2012, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/#in_browser">Protocol Buffers</a> 
stated that ProtoBuf was under the "New BSD License" and linked to
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause/#in_browser" target="_top">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause</a>,
which stated:

<blockquote>
<h2>The BSD 3-Clause License</h2>

<p> The following is a BSD 3-Clause ("BSD New" or "BSD Simplified")
license template. To generate your own license, change the values of
OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values as given here,
and substitute your own.</p>

<p>Note: You may omit clause 3 and still be OSD-conformant. Despite
its colloquial name "BSD New", this is not the newest version of the
BSD license; it was followed by the even newer BSD-2-Clause version,
sometimes known as the "Simplified BSD License". On January 9th, 2008
the OSI Board approved BSD-2-Clause, which is used by FreeBSD and
others. It omits the final "no-endorsement" clause and is thus roughly
equivalent to the MIT License.</p>

<p>Historical Background: The original license used on BSD Unix had
four clauses. The advertising clause (the third of four clauses)
required you to acknowledge use of U.C. Berkeley code in your
advertising of any product using that code. It was officially
rescinded by the Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of the
University of California on July 22nd, 1999. He states that clause 3
is "hereby deleted in its entirety." The four clause license has not
been approved by OSI. The license below does not contain the
advertising clause.</p>

<p>    This prelude is not part of the license.</p>

<p>&lt;OWNER&gt; = Regents of the University of California
<br/>&lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; = University of California, Berkeley
<br/>&lt;YEAR&gt; = 1998</p>

<p>In the original BSD license, both occurrences of the phrase "COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS" in the disclaimer read "REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS".</p>

<p>Here is the license template:</p>
