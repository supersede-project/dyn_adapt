    <h1>Synchronous Dataflow</h1>
    <p>
      Synchronous dataflow (SDF) is a special case of dataflow
      where the flow of control is sufficiently regular to be
      completely predictable at compile time.
      An SDF model is an interconnection of actors whose
      firings are enabled by fixed, pre-specified numbers of
      tokens on each of their inputs.  Moreover, when an actor
      fires, it produces a fixed, pre-specified number of tokens
      on each of its outputs.
      The fact that these numbers are fixed makes it possible for
      a scheduler to determine the firing sequence at the time
      the model is initialized.  Thus, SDF models are quite efficient,
      in that there is no multithreading needed, and run-time overhead
      consists only of a very
      simple dispatcher that implements the pre-computed
      schedule.</p>
