/** An interface for objects that can intervene in the execution of actors.
 *  A director that executes actors decorated by a resource scheduler has to
 *  consult the resource scheduler before firing the actor. If the resource
 *  scheduler returns that there are not enough resources available to
 *  fire the actor, the firing must be postponed.
 *  <p>
 *  For example, a resource scheduler could represent a CPU and actors scheduled
 *  on a CPU have execution times. The resource scheduler takes care of scheduling
 *  the actors according to a given scheduling strategy and keeping track of the
 *  remaining execution times.
