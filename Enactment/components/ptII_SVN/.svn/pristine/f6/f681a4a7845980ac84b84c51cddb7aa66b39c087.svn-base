    <h1>Giotto</h1>
    <p>
      Giotto is a domain designed by Christoph Meyer Kirsch to realize
      the semantics of the Giotto language, designed by Tom Henzinger,
      Ben Horowitz, and Christoph Meyer Kirsch.  The semantics is
      a particular flavor of a synchronous model.  Each component
      executes a specified number of times per iteration.  The number
      of times it executes is called its <i>frequency</i>, and it defaults
      to one.  The frequency can be specified to be something other than
      one by simply adding a parameter to the component named <i>frequency</i>,
      and then giving it a value different from one.</p>
    <p>
      A particular feature of Giotto semantics is that the arcs connecting
      components are updated with a new value at well-defined points in
      the execution, irrespective of their execution time.
      If the frequency of the actor producing the data for the arc is one,
      then the value is updated only between iterations.  Thus, each arc
      begins empty (having no value present), and acquires a value at
      the end of the first iteration.</p>
    <p>
      If a component has frequency greater than one, then its output arcs
      are updated more than once per iteration.  Suppose the frequency is two.
      Then its output arcs will be updated twice per iteration, but only
      the final update will be visible to components with frequency one
      (and only on the next iteration).  If a component with frequency
      two is a destination of one of its outputs, then that component
      will see each update, but only in its next invocation.
      Thus, the second invocation of the destination in the iteration will
      see the value produced by the first invocation of the source in
      the iteration.</p>
    <p>
      Giotto imposes the additional constraint that the frequencies of all
      components in a model bear harmonic relationships with one another.
      This means, for example, that frequencies of 2 and 3 cannot coexist
      in the same model.  Frequencies 2 and 4 or 3 and 6 can, however, coexist.</p>
    <p>
      The Giotto domain is highly preliminary, and the example models are
      not particularly interesting.  Watch this space for more interesting
      examples.</p>
