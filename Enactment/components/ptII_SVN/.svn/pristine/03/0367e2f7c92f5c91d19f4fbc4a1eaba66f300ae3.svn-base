/**
 * DEPRECATED: Use webSocketServer or webSocketClient module.
 *
 * Module supporting web sockets. Web sockets differ from HTTP
 * interactions by including a notion of a bidirectional connection
 * called a "socket". It differs from a TCP socket in that the connection
 * carries not just a byte stream, but a sequence of "messages," where
 * each message can have an arbitrary number of bytes. It also differs
 * from a TCP socket in that the connection is established through HTTP
 * and is supported by most web browsers.
 *
 * This module defines three classes, Client, Server, and Socket.
 * To make a connection, create an instance of Server, set up event listeners,
 * and start the server. On another machine (or the same machine), create
 * an instance of Client and set up listeners and/or invoke the send() function
 * of the client to send a message. When a client connects to the Server,
 * the Server will create an instance of the Socket object. This object
 * can be used to send and receive messages to and from the client.
 *
 * This module also provides two utility functions that return arrays
 * of MIME types supported for sending or receiving messages.
 * Specifying a message type facilitates conversion between the byte
 * streams transported over the socket and JavaScript objects that
 * are passed to send() or emitted as a 'message' event.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// Client

/** Construct an instance of a socket client that can send or receive messages
 *  to a server at the specified host and port.
 *  The returned object subclasses EventEmitter.
 *  You can register handlers for events 'open', 'message', 'close', or 'error'.
 *  The event 'open' will be emitted when the socket has been successfully opened.
 *  The event 'message' will be emitted with the body of the message as an
 *  argument when an incoming message arrives on the socket.
 *  You can invoke the send() function to send data to the server.
 *
 *  The type of data sent and received can be specified with the 'sendType'
 *  and 'receiveType' options.
 *  In principle, any MIME type can be specified, but the host may support only
 *  a subset of MIME types.  The client and the server have to agree on the type,
 *  or the data will not get through correctly.
 *
 *  The default type for both sending and receiving
 *  is 'application/json'. The types supported by this implementation
 *  include at least:
 *  * __application/json__: The this.send() function uses JSON.stringify() and sends the
 *    result with a UTF-8 encoding. An incoming byte stream will be parsed as JSON,
 *    and if the parsing fails, will be provided as a string interpretation of the byte
 *    stream.
 *  * __text/\*__: Any text type is sent as a string encoded in UTF-8.
 *  * __image/x__: Where __x__ is one of __json__, __png__, __gif__,
 *    and more (FIXME: which, exactly?).
 *    In this case, the data passed to this.send() is assumed to be an image, as encoded
 *    on the host, and the image will be encoded as a byte stream in the specified
 *    format before sending.  A received byte stream will be decoded as an image,
 *    if possible. FIXME: What happens if decoding fails?
 *
 *  The event 'close' will be emitted when the socket is closed, and 'error' if an
 *  an error occurs (with an error message as an argument).
 *  For example,
 *
 *  <pre>
 *      var WebSocket = require('webSocket');
 *      var client = new WebSocket.Client({'host': 'localhost', 'port': 8080});
 *      client.send({'foo': 'bar'});
 *      client.on('message', function(message) {
 *          console.log('Received from web socket: ' + message);
 *      });
 *      client.open();
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  The above code may send a message even before the socket is opened. This module
 *  implementation will queue that message to be sent later when the socket is opened.
 *
 *  The options argument is a JSON object that can contain the following properties:
 *  * host: The IP address or host name for the host. Defaults to 'localhost'.
 *  * port: The port on which the host is listening. Defaults to 80.
 *  * sslTls: Whether SSL/TLS is enabled. This defaults to false.
 *  * receiveType: The MIME type for incoming messages, which defaults to 'application/json'.
 *  * sendType: The MIME type for outgoing messages, which defaults to 'application/json'.
 *  * connectTimeout: The time to wait before giving up on a connection, in milliseconds
 *    (defaults to 1000).
 *  * numberOfRetries: The number of times to retry connecting. Defaults to 10.
 *  * timeBetweenRetries: The time between retries, in milliseconds. Defaults to 500.
 *  * trustAll: Whether to trust any server certificate. This defaults to false.
 *  * trustedCACertPath: The filename for the file that stores the certificate of a certificate authority (CA) that
 *     this client will use to verify server certificates.
 *  * discardMessagesBeforeOpen: If true, discard messages before the socket is open. Defaults to false.
 *  * throttleFactor: The number milliseconds to stall for each item that is queued waiting to be sent. Defaults to 0.
 *
 *  @param options The options.

//// Server

/** Construct an instance of WebSocket Server.
 *  After invoking this constructor (using new), the user script should set up listeners
 *  and then invoke the start() function on this Server.
 *  This will create an HTTP server on the local host.
 *  The options argument is a JSON object containing the following optional fields:
 *  * hostInterface: The IP address or name of the local interface for the server
 *    to listen on.  This defaults to "localhost", but if the host machine has more
 *    than one network interface, e.g. an Ethernet and WiFi interface, then you may
 *    need to specifically specify the IP address of that interface here.
 *  * port: The port on which to listen for connections (the default is 80,
 *    which is the default HTTP port).
 *  * receiveType: The MIME type for incoming messages, which defaults to 'application/json'.
 *    See the Client documentation for supported types.
 *  * sendType: The MIME type for outgoing messages, which defaults to 'application/json'.
 *    See the Client documentation for supported types.
 *
 *  This subclasses EventEmitter, emitting events 'listening' and 'connection'.
 *  A typical usage pattern looks like this:
 *
 *  <pre>
 *     var server = new WebSocket.Server({'port':8082});
 *     server.on('listening', onListening);
 *     server.on('connection', onConnection);
 *     server.start();
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  where onListening is a handler for an event that this Server emits
 *  when it is listening for connections, and onConnection is a handler
 *  for an event that this Server emits when a client requests a websocket
 *  connection and the socket has been successfully established.
 *  When the 'connection' event is emitted, it will be passed a Socket object,
 *  and the onConnection handler can register a listener for 'message' events
 *  on that Socket object, as follows:
 *
 *  <pre>
 *    server.on('connection', function(socket) {
 *        socket.on('message', function(message) {
 *            console.log(message);
 *            socket.send('Reply message');
 *        });
 *     });
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  The Socket object also has a close() function that allows the server to close
 *  the connection.
 *
 *  FIXME: Should provide a mechanism to validate the "Origin" header during the
 *    connection establishment process on the serverside (against the expected origins)
 *    to avoid Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking attacks.
 *
