expressly granted. (b) You may make a single archival copy of Software,
but otherwise may not copy, modify, or distribute Software. However if

lease, lend or encumber Software. (d) Unless enforcement is prohibited by
applicable law, you may not decompile, or reverse engineer Software. (e)

or comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior

use such software on a stand-alone basis or use any portion of such

Software may contain programs that perform automated collection of
system data and/or automated software updating services. System data
collected through such programs may be used by Sun, its subcontractors,
and its service delivery partners for the purpose of providing you with
remote system services and/or improving Sun's software and systems. (j)

construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun
and its licensors disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness
for such uses. (k) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark,
service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted
under this Agreement.

<p>6. Java Compatibility and Open Source.

<p>Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional
classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
at www.java.net.

<p>Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions
and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of
its products.

<p>Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter
any rights and obligations you may have under such open source licenses,
however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions
in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this distribution.

<p>7. Term and Termination.

<p>The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). Your
rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from
Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's
and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this Agreement
should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to
become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or
trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of,
and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections
1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the Agreement.

<p>8. Limited Warranty.

<p>Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which
Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials
and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is
provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under
this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media
or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations
on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This
limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others,
which vary from state to state.

<p>9. Disclaimer of Warranty.

<p>UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
BE LEGALLY INVALID.

<p>10. Limitation of Liability.

<p>TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS
OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF
OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you,
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable
to you.

<p>11. Export Regulations.

<p>All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered
under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be
subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree
to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that
you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export,
or import as may be required after delivery to you.

<p>12. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

<p>If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

<p>13. Governing Law.

<p>Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California
law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any
jurisdiction will apply.

<p>14. Severability.

<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

<p>15. Integration.

<p>This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is the
entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications,
proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any
conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or
other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter
during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will
be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative
of each party.
