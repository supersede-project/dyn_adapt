Specification for Supervisory Controller
----------------------------------------

The specification in ordinary English:
  - with translations into local terminology.

If fault occurs, open contactor within X time regardless of other inputs and leave open (no reset)
  - fault == true => contactor == false within X time
If switch is on, close contactor within Y1 time
  - onOff == true => contactor == true within Y1 time
If switch is off, open contactor within Y2 time
  - onOff == false => contactor == false within Y2 time
If input > threshold for Z1 time, fault output = true
  - voltage > threshold for Z1 time => fault == true
If input < threshold for Z2 time, fault output = false
  - voltage < threshold for Z2 time => fault == false
