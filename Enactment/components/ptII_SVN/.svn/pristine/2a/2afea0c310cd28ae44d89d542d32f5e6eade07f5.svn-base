# This is a bit of a hack.
#
# We use hudson to invoke "ant installers", which invokes 
# adm/test/junit/JUnitTclTest.java, which runs the tcl tests
# in this directory including this file.
#
# This file runs make in adm/gen-X.0, which creates the installer
# and then invokes the installer and runs the tests using make.
# We use ptolemy.util.StreamExec to invoke make so that we
# can get the output as it occurs and so that we can search
# stdout and stderr for error messages.
#
# Try to keep up.
#
# In the future, it would be good to migrate away from some of
# this.  Maven has potential, but our jnlp setup of having
# many jnlp files does not fit the Maven model.
