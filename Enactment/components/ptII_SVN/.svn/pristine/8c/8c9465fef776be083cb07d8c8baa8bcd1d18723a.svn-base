    <h1>Ptolemy II 11.0.devel Release Notes</h1>

    Ptolemy II is a set of Java packages supporting heterogeneous,
    concurrent modeling and design.  Its <code>kernel</code> package
    supports clustered hierarchical graphs, which are collections of
    <I>entities</I> and <I>relations</I> between those entities.  Its
    <code>actor</code> package extends the kernel so that entities have
    functionality and can communicate via the relations.  Its
    <I>domains</I> extend the actor package by imposing <I>models of computation</I>
    on the interaction between entities.  Examples of
    models of computation include discrete-event systems, dataflow,
    process networks, synchronous/reactive systems, and communicating
    sequential processes.

    <p>Ptolemy II includes a number of support packages, such as 

      <br><code>data</code>, providing a type system, data encapsulation and an
      expression parser,

      <br><code>plot</code>, providing visual display of data,

      <br><code>math</code>, providing matrix and vector math and signal
      processing functions, and

      <br><code>graph</code>, providing graph-theoretic manipulations.

    <p>The Ptolemy Book describes the Ptolemy II design and
      the implementation of the Java classes.</p>

    <h2>Complete List of Domains in Ptolemy II</h2>
    <!-- We include this list here since we will be posting the release notes
	 to the newsgroups etc.  See also main.htm
      -->
    <p>Ptolemy II includes a growing suite of <i>domains</i>, each of which
      realizes a model of computation.  It also includes a component library,
      in which most components are <i>domain polymorphic</i>, in that they
      can operate in several of the domains.  Most are also <i>data polymorphic</i>,
      in that they operate on several data types.
      The domains that have been implemented are listed below.</p>

    <h2>Platforms</h2>

    <p>The core of Ptolemy II 11.0.devel is 100% Java, so it should work on any
      platform that has JDK 1.6 or later.</p>

    <p>We developed Ptolemy II 11.0.devel under Mac OS X, Windows and Linux with JDK1.7.0_25 and JDK1.8.0_11
      Under MacOS 10.7.5, we were also able to use Java 1.6.0_26.</p>

    <p>Ptolemy II 10.0 will not compile under Java 1.3 because we use the
      java.lang.URI class, which is present only in Java 1.4 and later.
      JDK 1.5 or later is required so that these packages can use generics:
      backtrack, ptalon and others.  JDK 1.6 is required because
      ptdb uses javax.swing.GroupLayout and because of other changes.</p>

    <p>In the past, Ptolemy II has been compiled and run
      under IBM JDK 1.6.0.  However, the IBM JDK has not be tried recently. There are the following limitations
      under IBM JDK 1.6.0
      <ul>
	<li> The Copernicus code generator does not work.
	<li> Caltrop does not work.
	<li> The IBM JDK seems to return directory contents in a different
	  order than the Sun JDK.  Thus actor.lib.io.DirectoryListing
	  might return elements in a different order.
      </ul>

    <h2>Backward Compatibility</h2>


    <p>Most models developed under Ptolemy II 1.0.1,
      2.0.1, 3.0.2, 4.0.1, 5.0.2  or HyVisual 2.2-beta, 3.0, 4.0.1, 5.0.1,
      6.0.2, 7.0.1, 8.0.1 and 10.0.1
      should run under Ptolemy II 11.0.devel</p>

    <p>The MoMLParser includes a list of backward
      compatibility filters that make certain changes on models
      when read, handling such issues as actors being moved or renamed
      and parameter names being changed.
      The filters themselves are defined in
      <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/moml/filter/package-summary.html">ptolemy.moml.filter</a>.
      If you have developed your own actors under earlier versions of Ptolemy II by
      writing your own Java files, you should recompile all your java code with
      the new release.  In theory, copying the .class files should work, but
      recompiling is safer.

    </ul>


    <p>Version 11.0.devel has the following limitations:</p>

    <h3>Release Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> The gzipped tar file of Ptolemy II  source files with Unix line endings
	(<code>ptII11.0.devel.src.tar.gz</code>)
	<B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
	untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
	than 100 characters.
	<p>Note further that some of the .class names are longer than
	  31 characters, which may cause problems when downloading zip files
	  on the Macintosh and using Stuffit.</li>

      <li> The documentation for custom actors used in demonstrations is not
	included in the release.  The source code for the custom actors can be found
	in the source download.</li>

      <li> If a URL ends with <CODE>#in_browser</CODE>, then
	Ptolemy II will invoke the User's web browser.  Unfortunately, this
	does not always work, especially under Windows.
	The workaround is to exit Netscape and let Ptolemy II
	start up your browser for you.</li>

      <li> Web Start does not work very well if the pathname to the 
	<CODE>vergil.jnlp</CODE> file has spaces in it.  The workaround is
	to place your Ptolemy II tree in a directory that does not have spaces
	in the path name if you plan on using Web Start.</li>

      <li> If your user library contains actors that are not present in
	vergil, then you may see a dialog or dialogs asking if you want
	to skip these elements.  This could happen if you had developed custom
	actors and put them into your user library and these custom actors
	are not present in the release.  The work around is to click 'Skip Element'
	and continue with the start up.</li>

      <li> Web Start issues:
	<ul>
	  <li> The Matlab Wireless demo fails under Web Start.
	    The problem is that the Matlab .m file cannot be found.

          <li> The JAI Adaptive Median model does not work under
	    Web Start - the repaired image might be corrupt.
	    The reason is that it uses the JAI acceleration libraries,
	    which Web Start does not load.  

	  <li> Viewing a pdf file may bring up a blank window along with
	    the pdf file.  Running the code generator may bring up
	    a blank window while the java or javac processes are running.

	  <li> Some of the links on the GR domain instructions page
	    might not work under Web Start because the files they refer
	    to are not present. </li>
	  
	  <li>Under WebStart, in the HOC

      <li> Several higher-order-components will not work inside class definitions.
	(ModalModel, several Continuous actors, etc.).</li>


      <li> Name collisions can occur when adding objects to base classes
	whose names collide with objects in derived classes.
	Auto naming should look through the derivedList for name conflicts.</li>


      <li> Propagation of changes to a base class is very slow in Vergil.
	If there are more than just a very few instances or derived
	classes, interactive editing is not practical.  As a workaround,
	put the class definitions in a separate file and edit them
	without opening the model that creates instances. The probable
	reason is that MoMLParser handles propagation by issuing large
	numbers of change requests.</li>


      <li> Certain actors, such as MathFunction, change the number of ports
	when parameters change.  This violates the derivation invariance
	for classes.  To demonstrate the bug, put a MathFunction actor
	in a base class that has a subclass.  Change the function parameter
	in the subclass to anything but "modulo".  Then change the function
	in the base class to "modulo" (which adds a port).  Now attempt
	to insert a parameter into the port.  You will get an
	InternalErrorException when it tries to propagate the change.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Limitations in the Actor Libraries</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The actor library is far from complete.

      <li>The Expression actor does not properly propagate type constraints in
	an expression-dependent fashion. It works correctly for double-valued
	expressions of double-valued inputs.</li>

      <li> The Ptolemy parameter parser uses comma "," to separate elements
	in an array.  This causes problems when Ptolemy is run on
	European machines that use a comma "1,0" instead of a period "1.1"
	in floating point numbers.</li>

      <li> The Display actor uses the Swing JTextArea component which is 
	known to have memory leaks.</li>

      <li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.
	Instead, use readResource().</li>

      <li> IterateOverArray has the following problems
	<ul>

	  <li> IterateOverArray: When you drop in an actor, and then
	    another actor, and then select "undo," the second actor is
	    deleted without the first one being re-created. Thus, undo is
            only a partial undo. The fix to this is extremely
            complicated. Probably the only viable
            mechanism is to use UndoStackAttribute.getUndoInfo() to get the undo
            stack and then to manipulate the contents of that stack directly.</li>
	  
	  <li> IterateOverArray: There should be an option to reset
	    between firings of the inside actor.</li>


	  <li> IterateOverArray: If you drop a new actor onto an IterateOverArray
            in a subclass, it will simply acquire the new contents, but not
            actually do anything with them. It should somehow refuse to accept
            the new object in the subclass, since to do so, it would have to
            delete the original object defined in the base class, and this would
            violate the derived invariant.</li>

	  
	  <li> IterateOverArray: If an instance of IterateOverArray in a derived
            class has overridden values of parameters, those are lost if
            contained entity of the instance in the base class is replaced and
            then an undo is requested.</li>

	  
	  <li> IterateOverArray: When an actor with a display icon like
            Const, Expression, or MathFunction is put into
            IterateOverArray, the CopyCatIcon doesn't reflect the text display.</li>

	</ul>
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Limitations in the PN Domain</h3>
    <p>The PN domain documents that it locally handles mutations.  However, this
      is currently not true in the implementation.  For the basic PN model, this
      doesn't really matter, since mutations happen pretty much the same as they
      would otherwise.  (i.e. they are non-deterministic in when they execute) 
      However, for timed PN models, there is actually some expressiveness
      lost, since timed PN models can locally execute mutations deterministically.</p>

    <p>Embedding a PN typed composite actor inside a non-process top level
      such as DE does not work.  In fact embedding a process domain inside
      a non-process domain is likely to have problems.  Profess Lee wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Yes, it looks as if the code is designed so that process domains
      (PN, CSP) can only be used within process domains.  I'm not sure
      to what extent this is a limitation of the process domains vs. a
      semantic problem.  What would PN mean within DE?  Since PN has
      no well-defined notion of a "firing", how would you assign time
      stamps to the outputs of a PN actor?  By default in DE, the time
      stamps of the outputs of an actor match those of the inputs that
      triggered the firing. There is no such notion in PN.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Limitations in the User Interface</h3>

    <p>Below are some of the limitations of Vergil, the Ptolemy II Graphical
      User Interface.</p>
    <ul>

      <li> The labeling of ports gets messed up if you change cardinality.</li>

      <li> Cancelling a style change doesn't restore original
	state.  There are FIXME's about this in actor.gui.style.StyleConfigurer.</li>

      <li> If there are multiple windows open for a model, say, the top
	level vergil window and the tree view, or the top level window
	and the inside look of a composite component, when the top
	level window is closed, all other windows are closed, but the
	user is not prompted to save any change to the model.</li>

      <li> When setting the type of a port, we should provide a combo
	box that lists the common ports</li>

      <li> When creating a Modal Model, use Control-Right-Button to
	drawn arcs between nodes.  One potential workaround would
	be to have an information message in the status bar about this.</li>

      <li> You should not change the names of built in ports - The port
	mechanism should disallow port name changes on ports that are
	named in Java.  The UI could recognize this.  The UI should
	not allow the user to remove built in Java defined ports.</li>

      <li> Manually setting of the types of actors like ArrayToSequence that
	have constraints on their element types can cause problems.</li>
      <li> HTVQ demo is badly laid out when run under vergil.</li>
      <li>Weak support for multiports in the graph editor.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to control wire routing.</li>
      <li>Cannot have more than one vertex in a connection.</li>
      <li>No mechanism to set the width of a relation.</li>
      <li>The integrated web browser is not a full-featured browser.</li>
      <li>Debugger not yet integrated.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to add actors to the libraries.</li>
      <li>No dynamic class reloading.</li>


      <li> Plot windows don't resize when control panel is resized
	<br>If a model with plotters
	is executed using the run button on the toolbar, and
	then re-executed using the run control panel accessed through
	the View menu, then resizing the run control panel does not
	cause the plots to resize to fit.
	<br>Workaround:
	Close the model and re-open it, and then run first using the
	run control panel.
      </li>

      <li>There is no mechanism in the UI to save a model as a class,
	nor to save a submodel as a class.</li>

      <li>There is no mechanism in the UI to create a custom icon for
	a library element and store it in the right place.</li>

      <li>If an actor uses a slider, then the actor tree navigator pane
	incorrectly shows the slider as a subitem of the actor.</li>

      <li> It seems that if you close a model that has been modified,
	get prompted to save it, and select save, then the model
	is saved but not closed.  It should be closed too...</li>

      <li> When I select a large number of items from one model, and
	copy and paste them into a new one, they sometimes all get
	placed at the origin.  Strangely, if I then auto-place,
	and then undo, they get their original (correct) placement!</li>


      <li> Printing a model that contains transparent objects can result
	in problems when printing to Encapsulated Postscript (EPS).

	<br>If a model has transparent objects, then when it is printed to
	EPS, the resulting file is a bitmap instead of a Postscript
	description of the graphics.  You can tell by the file size (several
	Meg vs. several K) and by opening it in Illustrator, where in theory
	you should be able to ungroup and select and edit individual
	components.

	<br>The way Java prints EPS is that there is an implementation of
	Graphics2D that literally translates each graphics2D call into a
	Postscript snippet.  If Java detects any transparent colors or images,
	then the literal translation of each element independently doesn't
	work, so the printing code reverts to writing everything to an image
	and then sending the image, encapsulated in Postscript to the printer.

	<br>Solution1: Use one of these pdf writing programs to generate
	pdf-1.4 compliant pdf files, which have extensions to support
	transparency that Postscript lacks, and then print them to eps, which
	would use the distill implementation of the above algorithm.
	Or alternatively, we could switch to using pdftex instead of 
	latex-&gt;dvips-&gt;distill which should
	embed pdf for figures directly at the expense of less robust latex support.

	<br>Solution 2: Use the undocumented flag
	-Dsun.java2d.print.pipeline=pdl on the command line to force the
	printing to use the postscript path, ignoring transparency.
	Under Cygwin:
	<pre>
	  export JAVAFLAGS=-Dsun.java2d.print.pipeline=pdl
	  vergil
	</pre>
	Then edit the file by hand in Illustrator to add the transparency back in.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Limitations in JNI</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> The Interface to C actors using the Java Native Interface
	is not available via the Windows Installer (or Web Start).
	To use the JNI/Ptolemy II interface, you must download 
	Ptolemy II as source files and compile.</li>

      <li> The JNI user interface was removed between Ptolemy II 4.0
	and Ptolemy II 7.0 because the UI stopped working.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Code Generation Limitations</h3>
    Code Generation limitations are covered on the
    <a href="../ptolemy/cg/README.html">Code Generation</a> page. 

    <h3>Missing Domains</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Boolean and integer dataflow.</li>
    </ul>
