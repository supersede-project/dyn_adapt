## An arbitor considering failure operations

## Assume that the operator will always come once for a while
ASSUME ALWAYS (EVENTUALLY (operator))

## Whenever the error sign is raised, stop the process until the operator comes
ALWAYS (error -> (stop UNTIL operator))
ALWAYS (stop -> (!grant1 && !grant2) )
ALWAYS (req1 -> EVENTUALLY grant1)
ALWAYS (req2 -> EVENTUALLY grant2)
ALWAYS !(grant1 && grant2)

INPUT error, operator, req1, req2
OUTPUT stop, grant1, grant2
