<h1>Vehicle Management Systems (VMS) - Fuel Management Subsystem</h1>
<p>The demos to the left are a collection of Ptolemy II models illustrating various
modeling issues with cyber-physical systems (CPSs), using
a portion of a vehicle-management systems (VMS) that manages multiple
fuel tanks in an aircraft as an example. The details of how these
models illustrate modeling issues are covered in the paper:</p>
