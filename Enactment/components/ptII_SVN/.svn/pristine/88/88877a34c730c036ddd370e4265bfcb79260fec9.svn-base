David Broman, Christopher Brooks, Lev Greenberg, Edward A.
Lee, Michael Masin, Stavros Tripakis, Michael Wetter.
"Determinate Composition of FMUs for
Co-Simulation". 13th International Conference on

The work was done by Fabian Stahnke in 2014.

The entry point to the master algorithm is defined in main.c.

To run the master algorithm, run:

   make run

See the makefile for other targets.
