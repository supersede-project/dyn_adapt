/** Construct an instance of a Controller object type.
 *  This starts a thread in the java code that constantly reads input on the serial port that
 *  was linked to the sensor.
 *  If the code stops unexpectedly it is possible this serial port will remain open and
 *  ptolemy will need to be restarted.
 *  This code may be 'dumb' as it simply reads the input buffer
 *  whenever the getSample method is called and returns it. Checking whether this sample is a new one
 *  is done in the accessor.
 *
 *  Example:
 *  var imuSensor = require('IMUSensor');
 *  var stream = imuSensor.Stream();
 *  initialize:
 *          stream.start(bluetooth serialport #);
 *        setInterval(getSample, this.getParameter(samplingRate));
 *  getSample:
 *          var sample = stream.getSample();
 *          if (prevSample != sample) {
 *                  prevSample = sample;
 *                  this.send('stream', sample);
 *          }
