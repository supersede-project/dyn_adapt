    <h1>Ptides</h1>
    The Ptides model of computation focuses on model-based design principles for event-triggered real-time distributed systems. We are interested in cyber-physical applications with one or more of the following characteristics:
    <ul>
      <li>    Highly asynchronous stimulus response such that the periodic sampling used in safety-critical systems is not a feasible solution,</li>
      <li>    Mixed systems where periodic sampling and asynchronous stimulus response are both present,</li>
      <li>    Systems where knowing the precise time (at a fine grain than possible using periodic sampling) is required, and</li>
      <li>    Systems where the order of distributed events must be determined to high accuracy and this order preserved in any response. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The project is developing a programming model called PTIDES (for Programming Temporally Integrated Distributed Embedded Systems) and an associated software toolchain. The motivating applications are drawn from the domain of electro-mechanical (as illustrated by some test applications: Printing Press, Tunneling Ball Device) and energy (Power Plant, Synchrophasor) systems.

      <h2>Objectives</h2>

      <ul>
	<li>    Design and deployment of PTIDES programming model and its integration with network models and models of physical dynamics,</li>
	<li>    Design of a low-footprint distributed operating system that realizes this programming model, and</li>
	<li>    Development of program analysis techniques that check system implementations for satisfaction of PTIDES temporal semantics. </li>
      </ul>
