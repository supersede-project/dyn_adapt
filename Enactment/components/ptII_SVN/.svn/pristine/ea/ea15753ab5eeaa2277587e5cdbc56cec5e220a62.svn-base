The ptolemy.actor.gui.run package.
<p>This package is a draft of a facility that allows the user to edit the 
run window.  Work on this facility was not completed because Eclipse RCP
was seen as a package that was being regularly updated.</p>
<p>To use this facility, start up vergil, open a model and select
View -&gt; Interface Window.  In the resulting Window, use the Customize menu
to change the layout.</p>
