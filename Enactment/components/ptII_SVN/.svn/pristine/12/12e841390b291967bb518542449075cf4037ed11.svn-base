/** An interface for actors that handle WebSocket requests.  The interface
 *  allows the relative path for the WebSocket request to be set and obtained,

 *  implemented by an actor or attribute in a model that contains
 *  an instance of {@link WebServer}, then requests to that server
 *  that match the relative path set by the {@link #setEndpoint(WebSocketEndpoint)}
 *  method of this interface will be delegated to that actor or attribute.
