    // dragged from the Library over another actor on the canvas it
    // will replace this actor and Ports are reconeected. Also
    // Parameter values are used for parameters of the new actor if
    // they have the same name.

    // If an actor is dragged over a link this actor will be inserted
    // there. Currently this only works in Comad, where all actors
    // have an "input" and one "output" port."
