	* JFMI 1.0.2 released
	
	* FMIScalarVariable.setBoolean() This method now works properly.
	Previously, a ByteBuffer was used.  The correct type is an
	IntBuffer.
	
	* FMIScalarVariable.setString(): Properly allocate memory so that
	the Java side retains a reference.
	
	* FMIModelDescription.dispose(): A method that frees references to
	the Java handles to allocated memory.

	* FMUBuilder: Better support for building FMUs under Windows.
	
	JFMI can be compiled with gcj, which supports Java 1.5 or earlier.

	* JFMI 1.0.1 released
	
	The primary difference between jfmi1.0 and jfm1.0.1 is that there
	was a bug where boolean values were being reported incorrectly.
	
	A new facility is that if a shared file cannot be found for a
	platform and the sources director exists in the .fmu file, then
	make arch is run, where arch is the fmu architecture (linux64
	etc.)
