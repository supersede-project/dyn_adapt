/** Provide a base class for QSS methods for solving ordinary differential equations.
 *
 * <p>A QSS integrator implements one of the "quantized state systems" methods
 * for solving an initial-value problem (IVP) of a system of ordinary differential
 * equations (ODEs).</p>
 *
 * <p>A single QSS integrator may be responsible for an entire system of ODEs.
 * Alternately, it may be responsible for a subset of a larger system.
 * The latter approach allows building up a system from smaller components
 * that represent interacting subsystems.
 * Furthermore, each of those subsystems can be integrated by a different
 * variation on the QSS family of methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ODEs are represented using the <code>DerivativeFcn</code> interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>Class <code>QSSBase</code> provides a general framework for running a
 * single QSS integrator.
 * This framework must be supplemented in a number of ways:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implementing a specific member of the QSS family requires extending the
 * base class.
 * The subclass must implement the abstract methods declared here.
 * Those abstract "worker" methods provide the particulars associated with
 * the specific member of the QSS family.</li>
 * <li>Simulating a system comprising multiple QSS integrators requires
 * the supervisor to connect the integrators.
 * That is, it must match the states predicted by one integrator to the
 * input variables used by another integrator.</li>
 * <li>Simulating a system requires some supervisory control, for example to
 * regulate the time steps, and to sequence the exchange of information between
 * integrators.
 * See the API notes below.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h2>Background</h2>
 *
 * <p>Quantized State System (QSS) methods solve a system of ordinary differential
 * equations of the form</p>
 * <p><i>xdot = f{t, x, u}</i></p>
 *
 * <p>where</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>t</i>, simulation time.</li>
 * <li><i>x</i>, vector of state variables, <i>x{t}</i>.</li>
 * <li><i>u</i>, vector of input variables, <i>u{t}</i>.</li>
 * <li><i>xdot</i>, vector of time rates of change of the state variables.
 * That is, <i>xdot = dx/dt</i>.</li>
 * <li><i>f</i>, vector-valued derivative function.</li>
 * <li>The notation <i>g{y}</i> means that <i>g</i> is a function
 * of <i>y</i>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To solve this system, QSS methods rewrite the system as</p>
 * <p><i>xdot = f{t, q, mu}</i></p>
 *
 * <p>where</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>q</i>, vector of quantized state variables, <i>q{t}</i>.</li>
 * <li><i>mu</i>, vector of quantized input variables, <i>u{t}</i>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The quantized state, and the quantized input variables, are discretized
 * versions of the state and input variables.
 * The quantized version is a piecewise-continuous approximation, with a
 * functional form chosen to simplify the integration of <i>f</i>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The implementation here uses polynomial models to quantize the state
 * and input variables.
 * For example, QSS1 quantizes the state using a 0th-order polynomial (that
 * is, as a constant).
 * This means that for purposes of the integration, the state is held constant
 * over discrete intervals of time.
 * The method name, QSS1, arises since an internal, continuous version of the
 * state is maintained as a 1st-order polynomial (that is, as a line).</p>
 *
 * <p>The details of the methods are beyond the scope of this documentation.
 * See:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Kofman-2002</li>
 * <li>Cellier-2006.</li>
 * <li>Migoni-2009.</li>
 * <li>Migoni-2013.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h2>External vs internal state</h2>
 *
 * <p>Quantized state system methods expose a <i>quantized state</i> to users.
 * Internally, however, they track a <i>continuous state</i>.
 * Both are modeled using polynomials.
 * The polynomial representing the internal, continuous state has one more
 * coefficient than that for the external, quantized state (i.e., it is of
 * order one greater).
 * For example, QSS1 represents the quantized state as constant, but the
 * continuous state as a linear function of time.</p>
 *
 * <p>For the most part, the user does not need to be aware of this distinction.
 * In fact, for the most part the user only has access to the quantized state.
 * In particular, the user can access the <code>ModelPoly</code> objects used
 * to track the quantized states.
 * However, the QSS integrator reserves to itself the right to change the
 * parameters that define those polynomial models.</p>
 *
 * <p>In general, the API refers to an abstract "state" rather than to the
 * "quantized state" or the "continuous state".
 * However, some methods distinguish between the quantized and continuous
 * states.
 * For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Method {@link #evaluateStateModel(int, Time)} evaluates the quantized state model.
 * Since the user can access that model directly, this is mainly a convenience
 * method.</li>
 * <li>Method {@link #evaluateStateModelContinuous(int, Time)} evaluates the
 * internal, continuous state model.
 * This is intended mainly for testing.
 * However, since the internal model does represent the state as a continuous
 * function of time, for some reporting purposes the internal state may be
 * preferred.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h2>Terminology</h2>
 *
 * <p>The API and documentation presented here use some terms in specific ways.
 * Furthermore these terms do not always correspond exactly with those used in
 * the QSS method literature.</p>
 *
 * <p>The QSS method literature refers to "states" and "quantized states".
 * In order to avoid ambiguity, the code here refers to these as
 * "continuous states" and "quantized states", respectively.</p>
 *
 * <p>Variables for continuous states have names like <code>cStateMdl</code>.
 * Quantized states have names like <code>qStateMdl</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>TODO: Mention terms "rate-events", "state-events", and "quantization-events".</p>
 *
 *
 * <h2>A tour of the public API</h2>
 *
 * <p>The simplest use of this class is as follows. First, initialize the solver
 * as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Create an instance of a class that implements {@link DerivativeFunction}, and pass
 *      that into the {@link #initialize(DerivativeFunction, Time, Time, double, double, int)}
 *      method.</li>
 * <li> Then set the initial values of the state variables using
 *      {@link #setStateValue(int, double)}.</li>
 * <li> Then set initial input values by updating the models returned by
 *      {@link #getInputVariableModel(int)}.</li>
 * <li> Then trigger quantization events using
 *      {@link #triggerQuantizationEvents(boolean)}.</li>
 * <li> Finally, trigger rate events using
 *      {@link #triggerRateEvent()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * At this point, you can determine the first time at which a quantization event
 * will occur by calling {@link #predictQuantizationEventTimeEarliest()}.
 * Then, at each time step,
 * <ol>
 * <li> Advance to the current simulation time by calling {@link #advanceToTime(Time)}.
 *      This will return a list of state indexes that experience a quantization event
 *      at the new simulation time, and you can retrieve the new values of those
 *      state variables using {@link #getStateModel(int)}.
 * <li> Then set input values by updating the models returned by
 *      {@link #getInputVariableModel(int)}.</li>
 * <li> Finally, trigger rate events using
 *      {@link #triggerRateEvent()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * At this point, you can determine the next time at which a quantization event
 * will occur by calling {@link #predictQuantizationEventTimeEarliest()}.
 * That should be the time of the next time step.
 *
 * <p>The following methods initialize a new integrator.
 * They must be called before doing any work with the integrator:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #initializeDerivativeFunction(DerivativeFunction)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #initializeSimulationTime(Time)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following methods inquire about fixed integrator parameters:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getStateCount()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #getInputVariableCount()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #getStateModelOrder()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following methods set up the exchange of models between an integrator
 * and the rest of the simulation environment.
 * In general, they should be called before starting a simulation.
 * However, they may also be called during an integration:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getStateModel(int)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #needInputVariableModelIndex()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setInputVariableModel(int, ModelPolynomial)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following methods configure the integrator.
 * In general, they should be called before its first use.
 * However, they may also be called during an integration:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #setQuantizationTolerance(int, double, double)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setQuantizationTolerances(double, double)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setCurrentSimulationTime(Time)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setStateValue(int, double)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setQuantizationEventTimeMaximum(Time)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #validate()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following methods inquire about current values during a simulation:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getCurrentSimulationTime()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #evaluateStateModel(int, Time)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #evaluateStateModelContinuous(int, Time)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following methods prepare the integrator to take the next time step:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #needQuantizationEventIndex()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #needQuantizationEventIndexes(boolean[])}</li>
 * <li>{@link #triggerQuantizationEvent(int)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #triggerQuantizationEvents(boolean)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #needRateEvent()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #triggerRateEvent()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #predictQuantizationEventTime(int)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #predictQuantizationEventTimeEarliest()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following methods take a time step:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #stepToTime(Time)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The following methods primarily facilitate testing:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #stringifyStateModel(int)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #stringifyStateModelContinuous(int)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #findQuantum(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>TODO: Describe the general time-stepping model.
 * Steps only accomplished via method {@link #stepToTime(Time)}.
 * All other methods elaborate on what happens between time steps.</p>
 *
 * <p>The abstract methods that each subclass must fill in have names ending
 * in <code>_work</code>.
 * This is meant to help distinguish them from the general entry-points
 * provided by this base class.</p>

     *
     * <p>This method does not store the quantum calculated.
     * The QSS integrator is expected to take care of this.</p>
     *
     * <p>The nominal policy is to find the quantum whenever the
     * external, quantized state model gets updated.
     * This is because, as calculated here, the quantum depends on the constant
     * coefficient of the external, quantized state model.</p>
     *
     * <p>In principle, the quantum could be based on the current value of the
     * one of the state models, calculated at the time the quantum is needed.
     * This differs from the policy outlined above, in that the current value
     * of a state generally differs from its constant coefficient.</p>
     *
     * <p>However, this more complicated policy would induce a lot of mostly
     * needless calculations.
     * If the external, quantized state changes by a large amount, but still
     * tracks the internal, continuous state model well, then the quantum for
     * this element doesn't matter much.
     * If, on the other hand, the two models don't agree, then there will be a
     * quantization-event, which will trigger a new call of this method.</p>

     * <li>"Write access" on a model means that some object has asserted that
     * it plans to change the parameters of the <code>ModelPoly</code>.
     * This means it will control the trajectory of that model over time.
     * See method ModelPoly.claimWriteAccess().</li>
     * <li>The QSS integrator will change the model parameters as it integrates
     * the derivative function.
     * Therefore the integrator asserts write access on its own state models.</li>
     * <li>The QSS integrator requires exclusive write access on its own
     * state models.
     * In order for the integrator to run, every state model must have exactly
     * one claim of "write access" made against it.
     * Therefore the user must not assert write access on any state model.</li>
     * <li>The user should <em>never</em> write new parameters to the
     * state model.</li>
     * <li>The user should call method {@link #setStateValue(int, double)}, in order
     * to initialize the state, <em>before</em> starting the integration.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Notes on sharing models between roles in the integration:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>It is legal to use a state model as an input variable model of one
     * or more QSS integrators.
     * The model can even be added as an input variable model of the same
     * integrator for which it is a state model (although this should be
     * unusual).</li>
     * <li>It is legal to add the same model to multiple input variables.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     *
     * <h2>Design intent</h2>
     *
     * <p>The design intention behind exposing the state models directly to the
     * rest of the system is to make sharing state predictions as cheap as
     * possible.</p>
     *
     * <p>From an encapsulation viewpoint, the integrator does not have to
     * expose its state models to the rest of the simulation.
     * It could, instead, force the user to evaluate the quantized state models
     * using method {@link #evaluateStateModel(int, Time)}.
     * Alternately, it could copy the quantized state model to a user-supplied
     * model object, thus keeping the integrator's private copy hidden.
     * However, both these approaches are relatively high overhead, compared
     * to simply exposing the model for the user to evaluate as needed.</p>
     *

     * <li>That said, it is OK for the user to delegate the task of changing
     * the input model parameters to some other agent.
     * For example, an input variable can be the state predicted by an
     * integrator.</li>
     * <li>In order for the integrator to run, every input variable model must
     * have exactly one claim of "write access" made against it.
     * If the input variable model is also a state model (for this or any other
     * QSS integrator), then the QSS integrator will automatically make that
     * claim.
     * Otherwise, the user may have to make that claim.</li>
     * <li>Note that the QSS integrator should never change the parameters of a
