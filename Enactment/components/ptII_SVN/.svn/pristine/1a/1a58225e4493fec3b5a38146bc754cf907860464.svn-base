<h1>Actor Dependency Analysis</h1>
<p>
  The Dependency Results Dialog shows the prerequisites and dependents of an actor.
</p>

<p>
  The prerequisites of an actor are the upstream actors that have outputs that can
  send data to the input of the actor.
</p>

<p>
  The dependendents of an actor are the downstream actors that have inputs that can
  receive data from an output of an actor.
</p>

<p>To enable the Actor Dependency Analysis, in vergil select Utilities
  -&gt; Analysis and drag the
  <a href="ptdoc:ptolemy.vergil.basic.DependencyHighlighter">DependencyHighlighter</a>
  attribute to the actor and drop the attribute on the actor.
  The right click context menu of the actor will then get several menu choices including
  "List dependents &amp; prereqs".
