# This file contains modal tests that use the SDF director.

# The tests are sorted by size and have comments about whether they work.

# To generate the file, I did:

# grep domains `ls -l $PTII/ptolemy/domains/modal/kernel/test/auto/*.xml /Users/cxh/ptII/ptolemy/domains/modal/test/auto/*.xml | awk '{print $5, $NF}' | sort -n |  awk '{print $NF}'` |grep -v 'domains\.modal' | grep SDF | awk -F : '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | awk '{print "$PTII/bin/ptcg -language c " $1}'

#  grep domains `ls -l $PTII/doc/books/systems/fsm/test/auto/*.xml | awk '{print $5, $NF}' | sort -n |  awk '{print $NF}'` |grep -v 'domains\.modal' | grep SDF | awk -F : '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | awk '{print "$PTII/bin/ptcg -language c " $1}'


# Here are the tests.

# There are different classes of tests, below is the order in which we should fix them

# 0) Done: These tests work and have been copied to
#     ptolemy/cg/adapter/generic/program/procedural/c/adapters/ptolemy/domains/modal/test/auto

# 1) Result is non-zero, but wrong.   This one would be a good first test to look at

# 2) Missing actors.  Writing the Gaussian cg actor would help us
#  diagnose these failures.  There is also one model that uses
#  Bernoulli.  See the colt actors at
#  $PTII/ptolemy/cg/./adapter/generic/program/procedural/java/adapters/ptolemy/actor/lib/colt
#  I would hold off on writing a NonStrictTest cg actor, try Gaussian
#  first.  The models that are missing FileWriter have other problems, maybe wait on those.

# 3) Result was 0 when it should have been something else.  These
#  failures could be harder.  I've seen this failure elsewhere.

# 4) Fails to compile.  The modal model failures are not generate code, wait on those.
#  Looking over the simple failures could be interesting.
