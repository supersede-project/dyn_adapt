/**
 * BlockingFire is a wrapper for Ptolemy actors to adapt to MetroII semantics. It
 * provides an implementation of the state transitions for the abstract wrapper
 * FireMachine (@see FireMachine), which wraps an actor with a set of FSM
 * interfaces so that the actor can be seen as a FSM from outside. In
 * particular, startOrResume(event_list) is the function that reacts to the
 * MetroII events that trigger the FSM.
 *
 * <p>
 * The FireMachine has the following states. Each represents a state of the
 * wrapped actor:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>START: initial state.</li>
 * <li>BEGIN: the actor is not fired.</li>
 * <li>END: the actor is fired.</li>
 * <li>FINAL: final state.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>And each of the states BEGIN and END is associated with a 'state event',
 * which is the full name of the actor without model name plus one of the
 * following suffixes:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>FIRE_BEGIN</li>
 * <li>FIRE_END</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>For example, 'Ramp' is the name of a top level actor in a model 'Test'. The
 * full actor name is 'Test.Ramp'. The MetroII state event associated with the
 * state BEGIN of the actor is 'Ramp.FIRE_BEGIN'.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Neither START nor FINAL is associated with any state event.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p> To understand the transition table of the FSM,
 * {@link #startOrResume(LinkedList)}.</p>

     * When startOrResume(eventList) is called, the wrapper checks if the MetroII
     * event associated with the current state is changed to NOTIFIED. If the
     * event is notified, call related function of the wrapped actor, transition
     * to the next state, clear eventList and add the MetroII event associated
     * with the state to eventList (referred to as propose events). If the state
     * is associated with no state event, eventList is an empty list. The 'next'
     * state is defined as follows: STAR -&gt; BEGIN -&gt; END -&gt; FINAL. For example,

     *       action: propose FIRE_BEGIN
     * START ---------------------------------------&gt; BEGIN

     * BEGIN ---------------------------------------&gt; FIRE_END

     *       action: propose FIRE_BEGIN
     * BEGIN ---------------------------------------&gt; BEGIN
     * </pre>

     *            startOrResume() not the caller.
     * @exception IllegalActionException
     *                If the wrapped actor is in an illegal state or any called
     *                method throws it.
