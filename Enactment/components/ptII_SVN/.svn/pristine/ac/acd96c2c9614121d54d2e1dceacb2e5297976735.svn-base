/**
 This interface is implemented by attributes that wish to be consulted
 when a director advances time. In particular, the director will call
 the one method in this interface, passing it a proposed time to advance to,
 and the method will return either the same proposed time or
 a smaller time. The method may not return immediately. For example,
 it might wait for real time to advance to the proposed time, and then
 simply return the proposed time.
