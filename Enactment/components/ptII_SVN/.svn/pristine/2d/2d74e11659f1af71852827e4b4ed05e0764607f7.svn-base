//// MessageHandler

/**
 This is a class that is used to report errors.  It provides a
 set of static methods that are called to report errors.  However, the
 actual reporting of the errors is deferred to an instance of this class
 that is set using the setMessageHandler() method.  Normally there
 is only one instance, set up by the application, so the class is
 a singleton.  But this is not enforced.
 <p>
 This base class simply writes the errors to System.err.
 When an applet or application starts up, it may wish to set a subclass
 of this class as the message handler, to allow a nicer way of
 reporting errors.  For example, a swing application will probably
 want to report errors in a dialog box, using for example
 the derived class GraphicalMessageHandler.
