<h3>CapeCode - IoT Modeling environment</h3>

<p>Accessors, described in the paper, "A Vision of Swarmlets", are
actors that provide access to a (typically remote) service, sensor, or
actuator. An accessor is instantiated by an accessor host or swarmlet
host, which is a program or browser script. The host uses the accessor
as if it were a local source and/or sink for data and/or commands. An
accessor host is to the Internet of Things what a browser is to the
Internet. It renders a remote service by locally executing a proxy for
that service.</p>

<p>We are using the Ptolemy II modeling environment for its CapeCode
subset. Ptolemy II provides a mechanism for importing accessors from a
library and connecting them to each other and to library actors. The
default library of actors is at http://terraswarm.org/accessors, but
any directory or website that includes an index.json file that lists
available accessors is a library. Ptolemy II has a graphical
block-diagram editor called Vergil for composing accessors and
building swarmlets. Swarmlets in this host can mix accessors with
ordinary Ptolemy II actors.</p>

<p>The CapeCode subset can be invoked by passing the command-line
argument -capecode to vergil. This subset has the convenient feature
that it automatically imports all the accessors at
http://terraswarm.org/accessors and makes them available in an actor
library to drag and drop into models.</p>

The work is conducted in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Sciences of the University of California at Berkeley.  The
project is directed by Prof. Edward A. Lee.  The project is named
after Claudius Ptolemaeus the second century Greek astronomer,
mathematician, and geographer.
