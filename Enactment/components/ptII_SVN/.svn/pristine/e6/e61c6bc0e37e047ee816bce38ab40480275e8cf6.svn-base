WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

YOUR OWN RISK.


** NEWS **
----------

Version 1.2a:

- AElfred has a new maintainer.  Side-effects of this will include
  a gradual change in the indenting style of the source code, a
  mixture of Unix and MSDOS-style text files, and other things that
  people who actually use the source code will find annoying.
  
  The transition will be complete at the next numbered release.

- Source code directory tree has changed to reflect JDK 1.2 requirements.

- Other small tweaks to allow compilation under JDK 1.2.

- No longer crashes when reading longish files from a Reader.

- No longer hangs when syntax errors appear after the document element.

- aelfred.jar is no longer out of date :-).

- XmlApp, the base class for the included demos, no longer extends Applet.
  The new class, XmlApplet, now works both as an applet and application
  like XmlApp used to.  JDK 1.2 beta 3 had problems with this behaviour --
  if an Applet was constructed (but not used) in an app, its finalization
  would hang the JVM.  This change will persist even after the JDK bug is
  fixed.
  
  The demos, therefore, no longer work as applets.

- Performance should be somewhat improved.

Version 1.2:

- AElfred can parse from an InputStream, Reader, or a system ID
- resolveEntity() can return an InputStream or Reader as well as a
  system ID
- new SAX driver for SAX 1.0gamma (http://www.megginson.com/SAX/)


DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-----------------

In most Java applets and applications, XML should not be the central
feature; instead, XML is the means to another end, such as loading
configuration information, reading meta-data, or parsing transactions.

When an XML parser is only a single component of a much larger
program, it cannot be large, slow, or resource-intensive.  With Java
applets, in particular, few programmers would be willing to require
users to download an additional 50K to 100K in class files just for
the sake of adding XML capability.

AElfred is a new Java-based XML parser from Microstar Software
Ltd. (http://www.microstar.com/), an established provider of XML and
SGML solutions.  AElfred is distributed for free (with full source) for
both commercial and non-commercial use, and is designed for easy and
efficient use over the Internet, based on the following principles:

1. AElfred must be as small as possible, so that it doesn't add too
   much to your applet's download time.

   STATUS: AElfred is currently about 26K in total.  The compressed
    JAR file, including the optional classes, is only 15K.

2. AElfred must use as few class files as possible, to minimize the number
   of HTTP connections necessary.

   STATUS: AElfred consists of only two core class files, the main
    parser class (XmlParser.class) and a small interface for your own
    program to implement (XmlHandler.class).  All other classes in
    the distribution are either optional or for demonstration only.

3. AElfred must be compatible with most or all Java implementations
   and platforms.

   STATUS: AElfred uses mainly JDK 1.0.2 features (you may parse from
    a JDK 1.1 Reader if you wish), and we have tested it successfully
    with the following Java implementations: JDK 1.1.1 (Linux), jview
    (Windows NT), Netscape 4 (Linux and Windows NT), Internet Explorer
    3 (Windows NT), and Internet Explorer 4 (Windows NT).

4. AElfred must use as little memory as possible, so that it does not take
   away resources from the rest of your program.

   STATUS: On a P75 Linux system, using JDK 1.1.1, running AElfred
    (with a 4MB XML document) takes only 2MB more memory than running
    a simple &quot;Hello world&quot; Java application.  Because AElfred does not
    build an in-memory parse tree, you can run it on very large input
    files using little or no extra memory.

5. AElfred must run as fast as possible, so that it does not slow down
   the rest of your program.

   STATUS: On a P75 Linux system, using JDK 1.1.1 (without a JIT
    compiler), AElfred parses test files at about 70K/second.  On a
    P166 NT workstation, using jview, AElfred parses test files at
    about about 1MB/second.

6. AElfred must produce correct output for well-formed and valid
   documents, but need not reject every document that is not valid or
   not well-formed.

   STATUS: AElfred is DTD-aware, and handles all current XML features,
    including CDATA and INCLUDE/IGNORE marked sections, internal and
    external entities, proper whitespace treatment in element content,
    and default attribute values.  It will sometimes accept input that
    is technically incorrect, however, without reporting an error (see
    below), since full error reporting would make the parser larger.

7. AElfred must provide full internationalisation from the first release.

   STATUS: AElfred supports Unicode to the fullest extent possible in
    Java.  It correctly handles XML documents encoded using UTF-8,
    UTF-16, ISO-10646-UCS-2, ISO-10646-UCS-4 (as far as surrogates
    allow), and ISO-8859-1 (ISO Latin 1/Windows).  With these
    character sets, AElfred can handle all of the world's major (and
    most of its minor) languages.  To support other character
    encodings, you can supply your own Reader.

As you can see from this list, AElfred is designed for production use,
not for validation: it will behave correctly with correct files, but
it will not necessarily let you know when there are errors.  If you
want to verify on your system that your XML document is valid or
well-formed before you publish it to the Internet, then you should use
a validating XML parser.


SAX
---

AElfred now has a SAX 1.0 (gamma) driver built-in to the main
distribution, so there is no need to use an external driver.  The
class name of the driver is

  com.microstar.xml.driver.SAXDriver

[Ptolemy Note:  We moved SAXDriver.java into the driver subdirectory
because 'make fast' runs javac *.java, which was causing problems
because SAXDriver uses SAX, which we do not ship]

STARTUP
-------

To test the parser, you can try one of the demonstration applications
EventDemo, TimerDemo, DtdDemo, or StreamDemo (see descriptions below).
To start an application, make certain that AElfred's classes are
somewhere on your CLASSPATH, then use a command line like the
following:

  java EventDemo <uri>

Where <uri> can be relative (i.e. a file in the current directory) or
absolute (i.e. an XML document anywhere on the Internet).  Note that
StreamDemo takes a file name rather than a URI.

XML parsers like AElfred read one or more source files (called
&quot;entities&quot;), and merge them into a single stream of logical events,
such as character data, processing instructions, or the start or end
of elements.  The EventDemo demonstration application gives you an
idea of what information appears in the stream.


PROGRAMMER'S USAGE
------------------

To use AElfred in your own Java applets or applications, you need to
supply a class that implements the com.microstar.xml.XmlHandler
interface (say, &quot;MyHandler&quot;), create a new com.microstar.xml.XmlParser
object (supplying the URI of the XML document), then explicitly start
a parse:

  import com.microstar.xml.XmlParser;

  [...]

  String uri = &quot;http://www.host.com/sample.xml&quot;;
  MyHandler handler = new MyHandler();
  XmlParser parser = new XmlParser();

  parser.setHandler(handler);
  parser.parse(uri, null, null);

During the parse, AElfred will call methods in your handler to report
events; for example, whenever a new element begins, it will call your
method

  void startElement(String name)

There are thirteen callback methods altogether in the XmlHandler
interface; for details, see HTML/com.microstar.xml.XmlHandler.html:

public void startDocument ();
public void endDocument ();
public String resolveEntity (String ename, String publicId, String systemId);
public String startExternalEntity (String systemId);
public String endExternalEntity (String systemId);
public void doctypeDecl (String dname, String publicId, String systemId);
public void attribute (String name, String value, boolean isSpecified);
public void startElement (String elname);
public void endElement (String elname);
public void charData (char ch[], int start, int length);
public void ignorableWhitespace (char ch[], int start, int length);
public void processingInstruction (String target, String data);
public void error (String message, String url, int line, int column);

If you want to avoid implementing all of these, you can derive your
handler from com.microstar.xml.HandlerBase (see below), then fill in
only the ones you need.


REQUIRED CLASSES
----------------

If you want to use the XML parser with a Java applet, these are the
only two classes that you must install (in addition to your own class
that implements the XmlHandler interface):

com/microstar/xml/XmlParser.class              
                        The actual XML parser.

com/microstar/xml/XmlHandler.class      
                        The callback interface for the XML parser.


OPTIONAL CLASSES
----------------

There are three optional classes that you may choose to install on a
web site (all are very small):

com/microstar/xml/XmlException.class
                        A convenience class for reporting XML
                        parsing errors.

com/microstar/xml/HandlerBase.class
                        (Requires XmlException.class.) A base class
                        that provides a default implementation for all
                        the handlers.

com/microstar/xml/driver/SAXDriver.class
                        A SAX driver for AElfred.

[Ptolemy Note:  We moved SAXDriver.java into the driver subdirectory
because 'make fast' runs javac *.java, which was causing problems
because SAXDriver uses SAX, which we do not ship]

Neither of the required classes refers to these, and you may leave
them out of a web installation if you do not need them.


DEMONSTRATION CLASSES
---------------------

The distribution also contains some classes for the demonstration
applications.  Normally, you will not include these in a web
installation:

XmlApp.class            A simple base class for the demonstrations.

EventDemo.class         (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
                        application showing the XML parse events.

TimerDemo.class         (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
                        application that simply parses a document
                        without producing any running output (except
                        for errors and warnings); useful for timing
                        the parser on different documents.

DtdDemo.class           (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
                        application that parses a document and prints
                        out a normalised version of the document's DTD
                        (if any).

StreamDemo.class        (Requires XmlApp.class.)  A demonstration
                        application that parses a document from an
                        input stream rather than a URL.


PARSER QUERY METHODS
--------------------

In addition to receiving callbacks, your XmlHandler object can send
queries about the DTD back to the XmlParser object.  The results of
these queries are not guaranteed complete until after your handler has
received a doctypeDecl() event (for details of these query methods,
see HTML/com.microstar.xml.XmlParser.html):

package com.microstar.xml.XmlParser;

public Enumeration declaredElements ()
public int getElementContentType (String elname)
public String getElementContentModel (String elname)

public Enumeration declaredAttributes (String elname)
public int getAttributeType (String elname, String aname)
public String getAttributeEnumeration (String elname, String aname)
public String getAttributeDefaultValue (String elname, String aname)
public String getAttributeExpandedValue (String elname, String aname)
public String getAttributeDefaultValueType (String elname, String aname)

public Enumeration declaredEntities ()
public int getEntityType (String ename)
public String getEntityPublicId (String ename)
public String getEntitySystemId (String ename)
public String getEntityValue (String ename)
public String getEntityNotationName (String ename)

public Enumeration declaredNotations ()
public String getNotationPublicId (String nname)
public String getNotationSystemId (String nname)


CHARACTER ENCODINGS
-------------------

** WARNING: AS REQUIRED BY THE XML SPECIFICATION, AELFRED ASSUMES THAT
            8-BIT CHARACTERS USE UTF-8 ENCODING UNLESS YOU PROVIDE AN
            ENCODING DECLARATION.  UTF-8 IS NOT THE SAME AS
            ISO-8859-1, SO 8-BIT ACCENTED CHARACTERS WILL CAUSE AN
            ERROR UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY DECLARE &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; AS YOUR
            ENCODING.

The AElfred parser currently supports all of the following input
encodings:

UTF-8                   The 8-bit Unicode transformation encoding.
UTF-16                  The 16-bit Unicode transformation encoding
                        (two octet orders).
ISO-10646-UCS-2         The standard 16-bit Unicode encoding (two
                        octet orders).
ISO-10646-UCS-4         The standard 32-bit Unicode encoding (four
                        octet orders).
ISO-8859-1              The 8-bit standard used in HTML and by Windows
                        and Unix.

If you need only 7-bit characters (i.e. ASCII), you can declare the
encoding as either &quot;UTF-8&quot; or &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;:

  ?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;

If you use ISO-8859-1, the parser will run slightly faster, since it
doesn't need to do any character transformation on input.  If you do
not declare an encoding, then the parser will (for 7- or 8-bit text)
default to UTF-8, which will work for ASCII but is slightly slower.

Since Java has only 16-bit characters, the parser does not resolve
surrogate pairs in UTF-16; as a result, UTF-16 and UCS-2 are currently
identical.


ERRORS AND WARNINGS
-------------------

AElfred should always produce correct output for valid and well-formed
XML documents.  Since AElfred is not a fully conforming XML parser,
however, it will sometimes accept documents that are not well-formed
or are not valid, without signaling an error.

For example, James Clark has a error-reporting test suite available at

  ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/test/xmltest.zip

These tests cover only well-formedness, not validity.  With the 1997
version of this package, out of 141 tests AElfred _failed_ to report
errors for 31 of them:

002.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
006.xml                 '--' in comment.
014.xml                 '' in attribute value
023.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
024.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
025.xml                 ']]&gt;' in PCDATA.
026.xml                 ']]&gt;' in PCDATA.

My experiments suggest that reporting all of these errors would add
10-15K to AElfred's size and slow down parsing by about 15 per cent.


ABOUT THE NAME &quot;AElfred&quot;
-----------------------

AElfred the Great (AElfred in ASCII) was king of Wessex, and at least
nominally of all England, at the time of his death in 899AD.  AElfred
introduced a wide-spread literacy program in the hope that his people
would learn to read English, at least, if Latin was too difficult for
them.  This AElfred hopes to bring another sort of literacy to Java,
using XML, at least, if full SGML is too difficult.

The initial &quot;AE&quot; (&quot;&#198;&quot; in ISO-8859-1) is also a reminder that XML is
not limited to ASCII.

      The April tags accessor code uses code written by Edwin Olson

      These files are part of a modified subset of the april package created 
      by Professor Edward A. Lee (eal@eecs.berkeley.edu) that removes all 
      dependencies on external libraries and graphical classes and renames the 
      packages to follow Java naming conventions.

    <h2>
      License
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most of April is GPL'd, but we asked for and received a BSD license on 
      the Java april/tag code.

        I am okay with dual-licensing the Java code in april/tag and its 
        necessary dependencies under BSD clause license. (And since I'm 
        putting this in writing-- this does not extend to other software in 
        the april repository.) The specific license is included below for 
        reference, which includes an additional attribution clause versus the 
        one you sent.

      <p>
        That said, the java version is so ludicrously outperformed by the C 
        version that I'd really like to convince you to (somehow) use the C 
        version instead. It's not a C-versus-Java thing; the detector logic 
        itself is using completely new algorithms. It is also *much* cleaner 
        in terms of dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there some way to make the C version easier to use from Java? I'm 
        no fan of JNI either. Any ideas?

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software
    You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform

    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
    must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
    under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
    Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
    Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
    such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
    other code not governed by the terms of this License and
    distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
    You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
    for the Covered Software.

    4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised
    and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
    version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as
    provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has
    the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
    License under which You originally received the Covered
    Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the
    Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
    otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the
    License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
    available under the terms of the version of the License under
    which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You
    may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of
    the License published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
    and remove any references to the name of the license steward
    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
    (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
    differ from this License.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &#8220;AS IS&#8221;
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
    COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
    WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
    ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
    DISCLAIMER.

    6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
    breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
    beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
    assert such claim is referred to as &#8220;Participant&#8221;) alleging that
    the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
    the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
    the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
    the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
    under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
    notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
    such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
    Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
    or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
    taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
    payment or license.

    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
    LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
    NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
    SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
    SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Software is a &#8220;commercial item,&#8221; as that term is
    defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &#8220;commercial
    computer software&#8221; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. &#167;
    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &#8220;commercial computer software
    documentation&#8221; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
    (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
    rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
    lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
    provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
    under this License.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
    by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
    if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
    conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
    in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
    for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
    reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the
    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
    of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
    against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
    that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
    States export administration regulations (and the export control
    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
    distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
    of liability.

    NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND
    DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)

    The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of
    the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law
    provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
    District of California and the state courts of the State of
    California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.



    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991

    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  59 Temple
    Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
    this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
    Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
    change free software--to make sure the software is free for all
    its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
    Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
    authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
    software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
    instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
    charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
    or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
    use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
    do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
    for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
    it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
    that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
    get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.

    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
    and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
    copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
    certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
    this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
    and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
    is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
    will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
    the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear
    that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
    licensed at all.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work which
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
    distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
    &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work
    based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative
    work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
    Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
    and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
    is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each
    licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
    not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
    of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
    Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
    the Program (independent of having been made by running the
    Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
    intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
    absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
    Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
    for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
    portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy
    and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
    Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
    conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
    Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
    Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
    works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
    apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
    works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
    whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
    the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
    for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
    and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
    contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
    intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
    derivative or collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
    Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
    a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
    other work under the scope of this License.

    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
    of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
    following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
    interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
    source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
    plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
    used to control compilation and installation of the
    executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
    distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
    (in either source or binary form) with the major components
    (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
    executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
    License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
    from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
    or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
    are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
    License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
    any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
    copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
    it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
    the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
    the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
    further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
    granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties to this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
    patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
    issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
    License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
    License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
    your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
    obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
    way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
    entirely from distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
    intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
    in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
    any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
    of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
    protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,
    which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have
    made generous contributions to the wide range of software
    distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide
    if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
    to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
    the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
    excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
    in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
    License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
    this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
    to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following
    the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
    version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
    does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
    any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
    free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
    status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
    the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
    DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
    OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
    MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
    LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
    INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
    OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
    OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
    greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this
    is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and
    change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
    effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
    have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full
    notice is found.

    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
    does.  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
    published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the
    License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
    General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
    02111-1307 USA

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
    mail.

    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
    this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to
    redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
    details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
    commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
    `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
    suits your program.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the
    program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
    James Hacker.

    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
    program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
    library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking
    proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you
    want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of
    this License.

    &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2

    Certain source files distributed by Oracle are subject to the
    following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version
    2, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular
    source file's header the words &quot;Oracle designates this particular
    file as subject to the &quot;Classpath&quot; exception as provided by Oracle
    in the License file that accompanied this code.&quot;

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
    is making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms
    and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover
    the whole combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
    you permission to link this library with independent modules to
    produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these
    independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
    executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also
    meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions
    of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module
    which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify
    this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the

        of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after 
        You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a 
        particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such 
        Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable 
        means, this is the first time You have received notice of 
        non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become

        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted

      <p class="list">

      </p>
      <p class="list">
        where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and 
        are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 
        'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
        Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are 
        separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the 
        Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative 
        works of the Program.

      </p>
      <p class="list">

        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
        license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
        publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
        object code form.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
        license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
        import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
        any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
        apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
        the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition 
        of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the 
        Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other 
        combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
        licensed hereunder.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
        provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
        patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
        Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
        any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
        or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
        granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility 
        to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
        Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
        to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
        license set forth in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
        under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) its license agreement:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
        Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
        within the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
        Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
        Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
        responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
        like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
        of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
        commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
        create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
        Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
        such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend 
        and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) 
        against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising 
        from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
        against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
        or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
        distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
        obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
        In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
        notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
        allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
        claim at its own expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
        product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
        Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
        claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
        claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
        alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
        defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
        performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
        Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
        must pay those damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5. NO WARRANTY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY

      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
        the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
        action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
        the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
        software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
        Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of 
        the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
        fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
        Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
        time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
        rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
        granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and 
        survive.

        may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
        under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
        Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
        Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as 
        expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives

          1, as long as:<br>a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the 
          Program and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of 
          the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program, and 
          which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in 
          themselves,<br>b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work 
          which are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be 
          considered independent and separate works in themselves,<br>i. are 
          distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and<br>ii. 
          the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied 
          by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those 
          sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the 
          corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and<br>c. 
          any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative 
          Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance 
          with the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate 
          works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program, 
          a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.<br>If the above conditions are 
          not met, then the Program may only be copied, modified, distributed 
          or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL or another valid

          Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all 
          respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may choose to 
          redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of 
          the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the 
          Program, provided that the copy has never been modified by you or

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        <p>
          As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to version 3 of the

        <p>
          &#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this License, 
          other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        </p>
        <p>
          An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
          by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
          Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a 
          mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an 
          Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library 
          with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked 
          Version&#8221;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
          Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source 
          code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in 
          isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked 
          Version.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
          object code and/or source code for the Application, including any 
          data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work 
          from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the 
          Combined Work.

        </h4>
        <p>
          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License 
          without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
          facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an 
          Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed

            function or data, the facility still operates, and performs 
            whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
          </li>

        <p>
          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from 
          a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such 
          object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the 
          incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data 
          structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions 
          and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the

        <ul>
          <li>
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that

          taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the 
          portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse 
          engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of

            <ul>
              <li>
                0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of 
                this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form 
                suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to 
                recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of 
                the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the 
                manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
                Corresponding Source.
              </li>
              <li>
                1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
                the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run 
                time a copy of the Library already present on the user's 
                computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified 
                version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
                Linked Version.

        <p>
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
          versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
          differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the

          of the GNU Lesser General Public License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; 
          applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and 
          conditions either of that published version or of any later version 
          published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you 
          received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License ever published by the Free Software 
          Foundation.

        <p>
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide 
          whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
          shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any 
          version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version 
          for the Library.

      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE 
        PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF 
        THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

      <p>
        1. DEFINITIONS
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contribution&quot; means:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
        documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      </p>
      <p>
        i) changes to the Program, and
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to 
        the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular 
        Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was 
        added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on 
        such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
        the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in 
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and 
        (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &quot;Contributor&quot; means any 
        person or entity that distributes the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor 
        which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution 
        alone or when combined with the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this 
        Agreement, including all Contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
        license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
        publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
        object code form.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
        license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
        import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
        any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
        apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
        the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition 
        of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the 
        Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other 
        combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
        licensed hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
        provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
        patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
        Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
        any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
        or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
        granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility 
        to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
        Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
        to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
        license set forth in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. REQUIREMENTS
      </p>
      <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
        under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) its license agreement:
      </p>
      <p>
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </p>
      <p>
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      </p>
      <p>
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
        Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
        within the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
        Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
        Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
        responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
        like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
        of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
        commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
        create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
        Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
        such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend 
        and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) 
        against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising 
        from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
        against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
        or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
        distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
        obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
        In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
        notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
        allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
        claim at its own expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
        product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
        Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
        claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
        claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
        alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
        defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
        performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
        Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
        must pay those damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. NO WARRANTY
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
        OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
        distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
        exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to 
        the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
        laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
        unavailability or interruption of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
        ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
        WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
        LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
        NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
        DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
        HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. GENERAL
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
        the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
        action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
        the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
        software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
        Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of 
        the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
        fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
        Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
        time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
        rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
        granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and 
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
        but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and 
        may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward 
        reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of 
        this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement 
        Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation 
        is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign 
        the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable 
        separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
        distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) 
        may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
        under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
        Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
        Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as 
        expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives 
        no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor 
        under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or 
        otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this 
        Agreement are reserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and 
        the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No 
        party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement 
        more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives 
        its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

        This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the 
        terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, 
        supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="section0">
</a>0. Additional Definitions.
      </h4>
      <p>
        As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to version 3 of the 
        GNU General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other 
        than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
      </p>
      <p>
        An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode 
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an 
        Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library 
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked 
        Version&#8221;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code 
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are 
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data 
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the 
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="section1">
</a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License 
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="section2">
</a>2. Conveying Modified Versions.
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application 
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the 
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified 
        version:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to 
          ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the 
          function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
          part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        </li>
        <li>
          b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of 
          this License applicable to that copy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        <a name="section3">
</a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a 
        header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object 
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated 
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure 
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates 
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the 
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered 
          by this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
          license document.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        <a name="section4">
</a>4. Combined Works.
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken 
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of 
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for 
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that 
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
          covered by this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
          license document.
        </li>
        <li>
          c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during 
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these 
          notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of 
          the GNU GPL and this license document.
        </li>
        <li>
          d) Do one of the following:

          <ul>
            <li>
              0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of 
              this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form 
              suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine 
              or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked 
              Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner 
              specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
              Corresponding Source.
            </li>
            <li>
              1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
              Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a 
              copy of the Library already present on the user's computer 
              system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of 
              the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise 
          be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU 
          GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to 
          install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced 
          by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version 
          of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation 
          Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and 
          Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must 
          provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by 
          section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

      </ul>
      <h4>
        <a name="section5">
</a>5. Combined Libraries.
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
        side by side in a single library together with other library 
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this 
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your 
        choice, if you do both of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based 
          on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, 
          conveyed under the terms of this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it 
          is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
          accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        </li>

      <h4>
        <a name="section6">
</a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
        as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the 
        GNU Lesser General Public License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to 
        it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either 
        of that published version or of any later version published by the 
        Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not 
        specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you 
        may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever 
        published by the Free Software Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide 
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall 
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is 
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    and conversions to other media types.

    &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

    &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
