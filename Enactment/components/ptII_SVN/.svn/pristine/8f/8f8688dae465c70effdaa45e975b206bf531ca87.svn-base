/**
 * Module to filter images. This module provides a set of image filters,
 * each realized by calling the {@link filter} function, passing it an input
 * image, a filter name, and optional filter options.
 * The list of available filters is provided by the {@link filters()} function.
 *
 * This implementation uses code by Jerry Huxtable, licensed under
 * the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
 * The code is available at [http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters](http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters).
 *
 * The filters provided by this implementation include at least the ones listed below,
 * with options in the sublist (if there are options).

 * * __MotionDetector__: Detect motion and indicate it on the image.
 *   * _PixelThreshold_: Intensity threshold whereby a pixel is deemed to different (an int 0 - 255, with default 25).
 *   * _AreaThreshold_: The percentage threshold of image that has different pixels for motion to be detected (a double 0-100, with default 0.2).
 * * __Solarize__: Solarize an image.
 * * __Threshold__: Threshold pixels in an image, based on their brightness. Options:
 *   * _LowerThreshold_: The threshold below which pixels become _Black_. This is an int that defaults to 127.

 *
 * For options that specify a color, the color may be given as an integer where bits 24-31
 * represent alpha, bits 16-23 represent red, bits 8-15 represent green, and bits 0-7 represent blue.
 * Alternatively, the color may be given as a string of the form of a hexadecimal number,
 * e.g. "0xff0000" for red, a standard color name, e.g. "red", or a CSS-style color specification,
 * e.g. "#FF0000" for red. The color names supported are black, blue, cyan, darkGray, gray, green,
 * lightGray, magenta, orange, pink, red, white, and yellow.
