<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The 7z.exe file is not used in the Master Algorithm work.  Note that the 7z.exe file is invoked under Windows when fmus are built by Ptolemy II, see $PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/fmi/fmus/win32/.</p>

<p>eXpat is not used in the Master Algorithm work because the Master Algorithm work does not support FMI-1.0 FMUs. eXpat is not used by Ptolemy II.</p>

<p>libxml is used by the Master Algorithm work, see $PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/fmi/ma/parser. Code generated by Ptolemy II includes libxml source files.</p>
