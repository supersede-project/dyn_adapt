The FMUImport actor looks for the FMUImport shared library in $PTII/lib.

After editing jniToFMU, to update the shared library in $PTII/lib, run

  make install

Then, when you are satisfied with your changes, commit the shared library.


Under Linux, be sure to run the build under RHEL *NOT* Ubuntu.

This is because RHEL uses an older version of GLIBC.

So much for binary compatibility.

terra.eecs.berkeley.edu is a good RHEL machine to build this on.

If you build and install under Ubuntu, then the nightly build will fail with:


java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /home/jenkins/workspace/ptII/lib/libFMUImport.so: /lib64/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.14 not found (required by /home/jenkins/workspace/ptII/lib/libFMUImport.so)


Note that you must also build, install and commit under Mac OS X.

Windows is not currently supported.
