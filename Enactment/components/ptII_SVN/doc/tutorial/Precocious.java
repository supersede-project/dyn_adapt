/**
This actor adaptively establishes connections by searching for an
unused input port in the model and connecting to it. If the output
is connected to something (the width of the output port is greater
than zero), then the actor sends an integer on the output port and
requests a refiring at a time in the future determined by the
<i>firingPeriod</i> parameter. The value of the output is simply
the count of the firing, starting at 1.
<p>
If the output is not connected to anything, then the actor will
attempt to connect it. It does this by issuing a change request
that, when executed, will search for an unused input port (any
unused input port) in and actor in the same container as this actor,
and then will connect to it.
<p>
Note that getWidth() is used rather than numberOfSinks() to determine
whether the output is connected. This way, this actors search for an
input port can be silenced by just connecting it to a relation.
<p>
This actor is an illustration of the capability actors can have to affect
their environment, to detect faults (in this case, missing connections),
and to repair the model.  It is designed to be used in the DE domain,
or any domain that respects fireAt() calls.
