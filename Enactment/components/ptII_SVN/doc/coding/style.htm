  <h1 align="center">Ptolemy Project Coding Style </h1>

  <p>Collaborative software projects benefit when participants read
  code created by other participants. The objective of a coding style
  is to reduce the fatigue induced by unimportant formatting
  differences and differences in naming conventions. Although
  individual programmers will undoubtedly have preferences and habits
  that differ from the recommendations here, the benefits that flow
  from following these recommendations far outweigh the
  inconveniences. Published papers in journals are subject to similar
  stylistic and layout constraints, so such constraints are not new to
  the academic community.  This document describes the coding style
  used in Ptolemy II, a package with 550K lines of Java and 160
  contributing programmers that has been under development since
  1996.</p>
