Ptolemy II <a href="#1">[1]</a> is an open-source software framework supporting
experimentation with actor-oriented design. Actors are software
components that execute concurrently and communicate through messages
sent via interconnected ports. A model is a hierarchical
interconnection of actors. In Ptolemy II, the semantics of a model is
not determined by the framework, but rather by a software component in
the model called a director, which implements a model of
computation. The Ptolemy Project has developed directors supporting

and
<a href="../ptolemy/domains/continuous/doc/body.htm" target="body">continuous-time</a>
models.
Each level of the hierarchy in a model can
have its own director, and distinct directors can be composed
hierarchically. A major emphasis of the project has been on
understanding the heterogeneous combinations of models of computation
realized by these directors. Directors can be combined hierarchically
with state machines to make
<a href="../ptolemy/domains/modal/doc/body.htm" target="body">modal models</a>
<a href="#2">[2]</a>. A hierarchical
combination of continuous-time models with state machines yields
hybrid systems <a href="#3">[3]</a>; a combination of synchronous/reactive with state
machines yields StateCharts <a href="#4">[4]</a> (the Ptolemy II variant is close to
SyncCharts).

<p>Ptolemy II has been under development since 1996; it is a successor
to
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyClassic/#in_browser" target="_top">Ptolemy Classic</a>,
which was developed since 1990. The core of
Ptolemy II is a collection of Java classes and packages, layered to
provide increasingly specific capabilities. The kernel supports an
abstract syntax, a hierarchical structure of entities with ports and
interconnections. A graphical editor called Vergil supports visual
editing of this abstract syntax. An XML concrete syntax called MoML
provides a persistent file format for the models. Various specialized
tools have been created from this framework, including
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/hyvisual/#in_browser" target="_top">HyVisual</a>
(for hybrid systems modeling),
<a href="http://www.kepler-project.org/#in_browser" target="_top">Kepler</a>
(for scientific workflows), 
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/visualsense/#in_browser" target="_top">VisualSense</a>
(for modeling and simulation of wireless networks),
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/viptos/#in_browser" target="_top">Viptos</a>
(for sensor network design), and some commercial products.  Key parts
of the infrastructure include an actor abstract semantics, which
enables the interoperability of distinct models of computation with a
well-defined semantics; a model of time (specifically, super-dense
time, which enables interaction of continuous dynamics and imperative
logic); and a sophisticated type system supporting type checking, type
inference, and polymorphism. The type system has recently been
extended to support user-defined ontologies <a href="#5">[5]</a>.  Various experiments
with synthesis of implementation code and abstractions for
verification are included in the project.

Ptolemy II includes a growing suite of <i>domains</i>, each of which
realizes a model of computation.  It also includes a component library,
in which most components are <i>domain polymorphic</i>, in that they
can operate in several of the domains.  Most are also <i>data polymorphic</i>,
in that they operate on several data types.
