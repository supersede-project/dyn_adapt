/** A motion detector image filter.
 *  This filter compares each image to be filtered against the previously
 *  provided image to be filtered. If enough of the pixels differ by enough,
 *  then it modifies the image to be filtered by adding a small red circle
 *  at the center of gravity of the pixels that differ by enough.
 *
 *  The parameters of the filter are:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> <i>PixelThreshold</i>: Intensity threshold whereby a pixel is
 *       deemed to different (an int 0 - 255, with default 25).
 *  <li> <i>AreaThreshold</i>: The percentage threshold of image
 *       that has different pixels for motion to be detected
 *       (a double 0-100, with default 0.2).
 *  <li> <i>ModifyImage</i>: If true (the default), the modify the
 *       provided image with a visual indication of the location
 *       and amount of motion.
 *  </ul>
