This directory contains models of the best master clock (BMC) algorithm in 
IEEE1588 and a library of actors to build new IEEE1588 clock models. The 
library is contained in BMCLibrary.xml and can be imported into the Ptolemy 
graph editor window via File -> Import -> Import Library. Note that it takes 
some time to load the library.

Author of models and library: John Eidson
