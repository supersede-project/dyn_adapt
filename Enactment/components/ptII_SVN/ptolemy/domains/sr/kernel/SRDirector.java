/**
 A director for the Synchronous Reactive (SR) model of computation.
 The SR model of computation has a notion of a global "tick" of a
 clock, and at each tick of the clock, each port either has a value
 or is "absent." The job of this director is determine what that
 value is for each connection between ports. An iteration of this
 director is one tick of this global clock.
 <p>
 Execution proceeds as follows. The director checks
 each actor to determine whether it is <i>strict</i> or not by calling
 its isStrict() method (here, "strict" means that all inputs
 must be known before the actor can specify any outputs).
 By default, actors are strict. Strict actors are fired only
 once in an iteration. Their inputs are all known (and may
 absent) when prefire() is invoked. If prefire() returns true,
 the fire() and postfire() are invoked exactly once.
 <p>
 Specialized actors may be non-strict, meaning that they are able
 to produce outputs even their inputs are not known. Such actors
 must conform to certain requirements in order to ensure determinacy.
 First, such actors should check input ports by calling their
 isKnown() method before calling hasToken() to determine whether
 the port is "absent." Only if both isKnown() and hasToken() return
 true should the actor call get() on that port.
 A non-strict actor may be prefired and fired
 repeatedly in an iteration if some of the inputs are unknown.
 Once an actor is fired with all its inputs known, it will not
 be fired again in the same iteration.
 A composite actor containing this director is a non-strict actor.
 <p>
 Each actor's fire() method implements a (possibly state-dependent)
 function from input ports to output ports. At each tick of the
 clock, the fire() method of each non-strict actor may be evaluated multiple
 times, and each time, it <i>must</i> implement the same function.
 Thus, the actors are required to conform with the strict actor
 semantics, which means that they do not change their state in
 the prefire() or fire() methods, and only change their state
 in postfire(). This helps ensure that the actor is <i>monotonic</i>.
 Montonicity implies three constraints on the actor. First, if prefire()
 ever returns true during an iteration, then it will return true
 on all subsequent invocations of prefire() in the same iteration().
 In subsequent iterations, inputs may become known, but once they
 are known, the value of the input and whether it is present cannot
 change in subsequent firings in the same iteration.
 Second, if either prefire() or fire() call clear() on an output port,
 then no subsequent invocation in the same iteration can call
 put() on the port. Third, if prefire() or fire() call put() on an
 output port with some token, then no subsequent invocation in
 the same iteration can call clear() or put() with a token with
 a different value.
 These constraints ensure determinacy.
 </p><p>
 If <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> is set to <code>true</code>,
 then the postfire() method stalls until the real time elapsed
 since the model started matches the current time.
 This ensures that the director does not get ahead of real time. However,
 of course, this does not ensure that the director keeps up with real time.
 Note that this synchronization occurs <i>after</i> actors have been fired,
 but before they have been postfired.
 <p>
 The SR director has a <i>period</i> parameter which specifies the
 amount of model time that elapses per iteration. If the value of
 <i>period</i> is 0.0 (the default), then it has no effect, and
 this director never increments time nor calls fireAt() on the
 enclosing director. If the period is greater than 0.0, then
 if this director is at the top level, it increments
 time by this amount in each invocation of postfire().
 If it is not at the top level, then it refuses to fire
 at times that do not match a multiple of the <i>period</i>
 (by returning false in prefire()).
 If it fires, then in postfire() it calls
 fireAt(currentTime + period) in postfire() to request
 the next firing.
  </p><p>
 Note that currentTime, as usual, means local time.
 If this director is inside a modal model, then that current
 time may lag behind the time of the environment in which
 the modal model executes because time does not elapse while
 a mode is inactive. In fact, time may bounce around, since
 if a <i>startTime</i> is specified and the modal model has
 a reset transition, then local time may be reinitialized
 to the start time during execution. Moreover, if the
 <i>startTime</i> of this director inside a modal is greater
 than the start time of the enclosing director, then local
 time may actually be <i>ahead</i> of environment time.
 </p><p>
 This behavior gives an interesting use of SR within DE or
 Continuous. In particular, if set a period other than 0.0,
 the composite actor with this SR director will fire periodically
 with the specified period.
 </p><p>
 If <i>period</i> is greater than 0.0 and the parameter
 <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> is set to <code>true</code>,
 then the prefire() method stalls until the real time elapsed
 since the model started matches the period multiplied by
 the iteration count.
 This ensures that the director does not get ahead of real time. However,
 of course, this does not ensure that the director keeps up with real time.
