/**
 Given inputs that are either doubles or {@link SmoothToken}s, construct
 a SmoothToken output. If all the inputs are doubles, then channel 0
 specifies the value of the output, channel 1 specifies the first
 derivative, channel 2 specifies the second derivative, etc.
 If any channel is missing an input, then the most recently received
 input on that channel is used.
 <p>
 If any of the inputs is a SmoothToken, then in addition to
 their values specifying the value and derivatives of the output,
 their derivatives will be used as the derivatives of the output.
 For example, if channel zero has a smoothToken(1.0, {1.0, 2.0})
 and channel one has a smoothToken(2.0, {3.0}), then the output
 will be a smoothToken(1.0, {2.0, 3.0}).
 </p><p>
 The inputs need not arrive all at once. Each time an input arrives,
 the value of the input is interpreted as an <i>update</i> to the
 output value or one of the derivatives. Any previously arrived
 input tokens that are instances of SmoothToken are extrapolated
 before being used to update the output.  So for example, if this
 actor receives only an event on channel 0 at time 0 with value
 smoothToken(1.0, {1.0}), then it will produce an output with
 value smoothToken(1.0, {1.0}) at time 0. If then at time 1 it
 receives only an event on channel 1 with value smoothToken(-1.0, {1.0}),
 then it will first extrapolate the event it previously received
 on channel 0, to value smoothToken(2.0, {1.0}), and then combine
 it with the update on channel 1 to yield
 smoothToken(2.0, {-1.0, 1.0}). The new token updates the first
 derivative to -1.0, overwriting the previously specified first
 derivative of 1.0. The new token also provides a second derivative 1.0.
 Any derivatives provided by higher numbered channels will overwrite
 derivatives provided by lower numbered channels.
