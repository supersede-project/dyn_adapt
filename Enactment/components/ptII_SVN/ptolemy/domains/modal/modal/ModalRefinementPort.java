/**
 A port for refinements in modal models that are themselves modal models.  This port
 mirrors certain changes to it in the ports of the container of the container and
 in the ports of the controller and refinements of the modal model that contains it.
 It is designed to work closely with RefinementPort and ModalPort, since changes to the
 ports can be initiated in either class.
