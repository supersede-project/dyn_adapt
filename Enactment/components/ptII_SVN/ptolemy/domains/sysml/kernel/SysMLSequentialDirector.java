//// SysMLSequentialDirector

/**
 <p>
 Sequential version of a SysML director. This version is inspired by a
 subset of the semantics of IBM Rational's Rhapsody SysML tool.
 In this MoC, all actors execute in the same thread.
 Inputs provided to an input port (by another actor) are
 put into a single queue managed by this director.
 This director executes by first initializing all actors
 (which may cause them to place events on the queue and/or
 to request firings at future times, "timeouts").
 Then, in each iteration, this director retrieves one event
 from the queue, offers it to the destination actor as
 an input, and fires that destination actor. That actor
 may put events on the event queue and/or request firings
 at future times. The director continues
 doing this until there are no more events to be
 processed at the current time.
 At that point, it allows time to advance, and first all
 actors that whose timeouts match the time advance, in the
 same order in which they asserted those timeouts (in previous
 firings). Those firings may again place events in the event queue,
 so this director will again fire actors until the event queue
 is empty.
 <p>
 Ports that are marked as flow ports (which contain an attribute
 named "flow" with value "true") are treated specially.
 First, the value on such ports is persistent. It does not
 disappear after being read, unlike the events that arrive
 on standard ports. Second, when a new value is sent to a flow
 port, the new value is made immediately available to the
 destination actor, and a "change event" is placed on the event
 queue. The change event ensures that the actor is notified of
 the changed value, but the actor may actually notice the change
 value before it processes the change event, if there are already
 other events in the queue destined for that actor.
 <p>
 This director is related to the DE director, with some key
 differences. First, it handles only one event from the
 event queue at a time. Second, the dependencies between
 actors are ignored. Third, it supports "flow ports,"
 which have persistent value, and "change events," which
 indicate to an actor that the value on a flow port has
 changed.
 <p>
 Unlike the DE director, the order in which actors are
 initialized affects the execution because it affects
 the initial order in which events are placed on the event
 queue. After that, if the actors are deterministic,
 then the execution is deterministic.
