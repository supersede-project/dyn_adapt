//// SysMLConcurrentDirector

/**
 <p>
 Concurrent version of a SysML director. This version is inspired by a
 subset of the semantics of IBM Rational's Rhapsody SysML tool.
 In this MoC, each actor executes in its own thread (corresponding
 to an "active object" in SysML). Inputs provided to an input
 port (by the thread of another actor) are put into a single queue
 belonging to the destination actor. The thread for the
 destination actor retrieves the first input in the queue
 and uses it to set the value of exactly one input port.
 All other input ports are marked absent. The actor then
 fires, possibly producing one or more outputs which are
 directed to their destination actors.
 <p>
 When multiple actors send tokens to an actor,
 whether to the same port or to distinct ports,
 this MoC is nondeterministic. The order in which the
 tokens are processed will depend on the happenstances
 of scheduling, since the tokens are put into a single queue
 in the order in which they arrive.
 <p>
 In this MoC, we assume that an actor iterates within its
 thread only if either it has called fireAt() to request a
 future firing (or a re-firing at the current time), or
 it has at least one event in its input queue. Thus, the
 actor's thread will block until one of those conditions
 is satisfied.
 <p>
 When all threads are blocked, then if at least one has
 called fireAt() to request a future firing, then this director
 will advance model time to the smallest time of such a request,
 and then again begin executing actors until they all block.
 <p>
 When all actors are blocked, and none has called fireAt(),
 the model terminates.
