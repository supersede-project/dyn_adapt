/**
 Display an image on the screen using the ptolemy.media.Picture
 class.  For a sequence of images that are all the same size, this
 class will continually update the picture with new data.  If the
 size of the input image changes, then a new Picture object is
 created.  This class will only accept a IntMatrixToken on its
 input, and assumes that the input image contains greyscale pixel
 intensities between 0 and 255 (inclusive).  The token is
 read in postfire().

 <p>Note that this actor really should be replaced by a conversion
 actor that converts IntMatrixTokens to ImageTokens.  However,
 there is no easy way to do that without accessing the graphical
 context of the actor.  An alternative would be to use the
 Java Advanced Imaging package and create an actor like
 $PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/jai/DoubleMatrixToJAI.java.
