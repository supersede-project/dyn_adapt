/**
 A simple sink actor that consumes and discards input tokens of type General.

 <p>The primary use of this actor is that it is used when the MoML
 filter replaces actors that take a General input, like ImageDisplay.
 A Discard actor is not sufficient because the type of the input is
 not set. If backward type propagation is in use, a Discard actor that
 has type General is needed to replace the ImageDIsplay that have inputs of
 type General.</p>
