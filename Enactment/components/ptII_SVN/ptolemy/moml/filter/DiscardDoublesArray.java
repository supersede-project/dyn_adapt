/**
 A simple sink actor that consumes and discards arrays of double input
 tokens.

 <p>The primary use of this actor is that it is used when the MoML
 filter replaces plotters.  A Discard actor is not sufficient because
 the type of the input is general.  If backward type propagation is in
 use, a Discard actor that accepts arrays of double is needed to
 replace the plotters that have inputs of type double array.</p>
