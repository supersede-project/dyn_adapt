/**
 A director that uses static scheduling to govern the execution of the
 CompositeActor it belongs to. <p>

 This class does not directly implement a scheduling algorithm, but
 defers to its contained scheduler.  The contained scheduler creates an
 instance of the Schedule class which determines the number of times
 each actor should be fired and their firing order.  This allows new
 scheduling algorithms to be easily created for existing domains.<p>

 This class is generally useful for statically scheduled domains where
 a schedule can be constructed once and used to repeatedly execute the
 model.  The Scheduler class caches the schedule until the model changes
 so that the schedule does not have to be recomputed.
