/**  A service discovery function for the Javascript Nashorn engine.
 *
 *  The long term goal is to provide a discovery process based on a defined ontology
 *  for a particular category of services. Right now, the list of services are known a-priori
 *  and specified as interfaces (e.g. GSNInterface.js) that context aware accessor can  include using the
 *  'implement' function.
 *
 *  The known services are obtained via the services() function which is implemented
 *  by the method availableServices() in the helper class.
