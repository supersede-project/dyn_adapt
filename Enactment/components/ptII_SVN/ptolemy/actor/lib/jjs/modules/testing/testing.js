 *  loadTestFile(filename): Load the given test file.
 *  run(): Execute the loaded test file.
 *  
 *  In the future, it would also be helpful to have:
 *  clearTests(): Clear all currently loaded tests.
 *  loadTests(string): Load the tests in the given string.
 *  setReporter(enum): Set the format of the output to one of the reporter choices. 
 *  
 *  Testing emits an 'end' event upon completion of all tests and supplies the
 *  results of the tests.
