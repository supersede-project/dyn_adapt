//// Subscriber

/**
 This actor subscribes to tokens on a named channel. The tokens are
 "tunneled" from an instance of Publisher that names the same channel.
 If {@link #global} is false (the default), then this subscriber
 will only see instances of Publisher that are under the
 control of the same director. That is, it can
 be at a different level of the hierarchy, or in an entirely different
 composite actor, as long as the relevant composite actors are
 transparent (have no director). If {@link #global} is true,
 then the publisher may be anywhere in the model, as long as its
 <i>global</i> parameter is also true.
 <p>
 Any number of instances of Subscriber can subscribe to the same
 channel.
 <p>
 This actor actually has a hidden input port that is connected
 to the publisher via hidden "liberal links" (links that are
 allowed to cross levels of the hierarchy).  Consequently,
 any data dependencies that the director might assume on a regular
 "wired" connection will also be assumed across Publisher-Subscriber
 pairs.  Similarly, type constraints will propagate across
 Publisher-Subscriber pairs. That is, the type of the Subscriber
 output will match the type of the Publisher input.
