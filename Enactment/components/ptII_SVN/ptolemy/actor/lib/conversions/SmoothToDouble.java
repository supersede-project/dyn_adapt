/**
 Convert a {@link SmoothToken} (one that has a double value and an array of
 derivatives) to a DoubleToken, discarding the derivative information.
 Normally, such a conversion is not necessary
 because any actor that can accept a DoubleToken can also transparently
 accept a SmoothToken. However, when an input port receives a SmoothToken,
 the port becomes <i>persistent</i>, meaning that it will always have a token.
 If an actor reads from this input port at a time when no SmoothToken has arrived,
 then the most recently received SmoothToken will be extrapolated, using its
 derivative information, to obtain a value at that time. If you wish for a
 downstream port to not be persistent, then you can use this actor to convert
 the signal.  Downstream input ports will be absent at all times except those
 when an actual token is sent.
