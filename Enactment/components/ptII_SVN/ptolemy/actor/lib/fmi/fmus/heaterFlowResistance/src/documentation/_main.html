<h1>heaterFlowResistance.fmu</h1>
<p>
The heater with flow resistance implements the following equations: 
<pre>
  outlet.m_flow = inlet.m_flow                               (1)
  outlet.T = TSet                                            (2)
  outlet.p = inlet.p - k * abs(inlet.m_flow) * inlet.m_flow  (3)
</pre>
where <code>inlet</code> and <code>outlet</code> are the inlet and outlet ports,
<code>m_flow</code> is the mass flow rate,
<code>T</code> is the temperature and
<code>p</code> is the absolute pressure.
The outlet setpoint temperature <code>TSet</code> is an input
and the flow coefficient <code>k</code> is a parameter.
</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
Because the flow versus pressure drop equation (3)
is not regularized near zero flow, this model should not be
used around <code>inlet.m_flow=0</code> if the model is combined
with a solver that requires the derivatives of the
model equations to be bounded.
This is for example the case if the model is used
within an algebraic loop that is solved using a Newton-Raphson
solver.
