The FMI++ library is a C++ utility package that offers high-level access and simulation functionalities on top of the FMI for Model Exchange specification. This includes for example automated numerical integration, advanced event handling or simulation rollbacks.

<p>The FMI++ library intends to promote the FMI specification and encourages the use of FMUs in modern simulation environments. It is distributed using a BSD-like license and suggestions or contributions are heartly welcome.
