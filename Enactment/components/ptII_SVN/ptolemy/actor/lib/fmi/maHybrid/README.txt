Notes:
	This is an implementation of a Master Algorithm (MA) for the simulation of Hybrid Systems.
	This MA works as a laboratory for the definition of the semantics and the API for the future
	FMI for Hybrid CoSimulation.
	The API implemented here is still under development.
	This is used just as a laboratory to proof concepts.
