//// CatchUpComposite

/**
This composite allows events to occur in the inside model
between the times when the outside model invokes this composite.
The inside model is required to have a director.
<p>
When this composite actor is fired, it fires the
inside model to process any unprocessed events it may have
at earlier times than the environment time of the firing.
If in any of these "catch up" firings the inside model
attempts to produce outputs, this director will throw an
exception. This director then transfers any available
inputs to the inside model and fires the inside model
one more time. On this "caught up" firing, the inside
model is permitted to produce outputs.
<p>
Note that a firing of this composite results in one
or more complete iterations of the inside model, including
invocations of postfire. Thus, this actor changes state
in the fire() method, and hence only implements the
weak actor semantics. Therefore, it should not be used
inside domains that require a strict actor semantics,
such as Continuous, which requires that fire() not
change state (so that backtracking can occur).
This composite probably can be used in SR, where it
will be treated as a strict as actor and hence will be
fired only once per iteration, and only when all inputs
are known.
