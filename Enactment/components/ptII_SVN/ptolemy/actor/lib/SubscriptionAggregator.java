/**
 Aggregate data produced by multiple publishers.
 This is a generalization of the Subscriber (the base class)
 where the channel name is interpreted as a regular expression.
 Data produced by all publishers that publish on a channel name
 that matches the regular expression are aggregated using the
 operation given by the <i>operation</i> parameter.

 <p>Note that the {@link ptolemy.actor.lib.Subscriber#channel <i>channel</i>}
 parameter of the superclass is now a regular expression in this class.
 Thus, this class is usually slower than the superclass.  One thing
 to watch out for is using <code>.</code> instead of <code>\.</code>
 and <code>*</code> instead of <code>.+</code>.
 For example, <code>channel.foo.*</code> does not mean the same thing as
 <code>channel\.foo.+</code>. The latter requires a dot between channel and
 foo, where the former does not.
