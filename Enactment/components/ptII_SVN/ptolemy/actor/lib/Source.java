/**
 Base for simple data sources.  This provides an output
 port and a trigger input port, both exposed as public variables.
 The trigger port is a multiport with undeclared type, meaning that
 you can supply it with any data type.  The trigger port can also be
 left unconnected.  The purpose of the trigger input is to
 (optionally) supply events that cause the actor to fire.  If the
 port is connected to something, then this actor will check it
 for a token and return false from prefire() if there is no token.
 each channel of the trigger input, if any, and then discards the
 token.
 <p>
 Some derived classes may attach additional significance to an input
 on the trigger port. For example, they might fix the type and attach
 some significance to the value.  Note that it is not recommend to
 use getWidth() on the port to determine whether the port is connected,
 since the width may be greater than zero even if there
 is no actual source of data.  This can occur, for example, if a trigger port
 is connected to the inside of a port of an opaque composite actor, and
 there is nothing connected to the outside of that port. It is not
 recommended to make the behavior of an actor dependent on a global
 property such as whether there is ultimately a source of data.</p>
 <p>
 Any type of data on is accepted on the trigger port, therefore no
 type is declared. Instead, the type resolution algorithm finds
 the least fixed point. If backward type inference is enabled, and
 no type has been declared for the trigger, it is constrained to be
 equal to <code>BaseType.GENERAL</code>. This will result in upstream
 ports resolving to the most general type rather than the most specific.
 </p>
