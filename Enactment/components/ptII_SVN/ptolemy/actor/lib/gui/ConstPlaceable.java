/**
 Produce a constant output from an actor that is placeable in a GUI.

 <p>The value of the
 output is that of the token contained by the <i>value</i> parameter,
 which by default is an IntToken with value 1. The type of the output
 is that of <i>value</i> parameter.
 <p>
 If the trigger port is connected, then this actor fires only if a token is
 provided on any channel of the trigger port. The value of that token
 does not matter. Specifically, if there is no such token, the prefire()
 method returns false.</p>
