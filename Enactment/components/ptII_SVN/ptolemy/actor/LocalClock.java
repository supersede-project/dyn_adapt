/** A clock that keeps track of model time at a level of the model hierarchy
 *  and relates it to the time of the enclosing model, if there is one. The time
 *  of the enclosing model is referred to as the environment time. This
 *  clock has a notion of local time and committed time. The committed time
 *  is "simultaneous" with the environment time.
 *
 *  <p>The local time is
 *  not allowed to move backwards past the committed time, but ahead
 *  of that time, it can move around at will. </p>
 *  <p>
 *  There is no way of explicitly committing time, but
 *  several methods have the side effect of committing the current
 *  local time. For example, {@link #setClockDrift(double)} will commit
 *  the current local time and change the clock drift.  So will
 *  {@link #start()} and {@link #stop()} </p>
 *
 *  <p>
 *  This class implements the AbstractSettableAttribute interface because
 *  we want the localClock to be shown as a parameter in the editor
 *  dialogue of a director. A better implementation would be to derive
 *  LocalClock from Attribute and make changes to vergil such that
 *  Attributes are displayed in the dialogue, however, for the moment,
 *  the required changes are too complex.
 *  The value of the clock is exposed as an attribute that, by default,
 *  is non editable. The clock drift is a contained attribute that can
 *  be modified. </p>
 *
 *  <p> This class also specifies a <i>globalTimeResolution</i>
 *  parameter. This is a double with default 1E-10, which is
 *  10<sup>-10</sup>.  All time values are rounded to the nearest
 *  multiple of this value. If the value is changed during a run, an
 *  exception is thrown.  This is a shared parameter, which means that
 *  all instances of Director in the model will have the same value
 *  for this parameter. Changing one of them changes all of them. </p>
 *
 *  <p>FIXME: Setting of clock drift must be controlled because it commits
 *  time. </p>
