/**
 This application creates one or more Ptolemy II models given a
 classname on the command line, and then executes those models, each in
 its own thread.  Each specified class should be derived from
 CompositeActor, and should have a constructor that takes a single
 argument, an instance of Workspace.  If the model does not contain
 a manager, then one will be created for it. The model is displayed using
 an instance of ModelFrame, which provides controls for executing
 the model and setting its top-level and director parameters.
 <p>
 The command-line arguments can also set parameter values for any
 parameter in the models, with the name given relative to the top-level
 entity.  For example, to specify the iteration count in an SDF model,
 you can invoke this on the command line as follows:
 <pre>
 java -classpath $PTII ptolemy.actor.gui.CompositeActorApplication \
 -director.iterations 1000 \
 -class ptolemy.domains.sdf.demo.Butterfly.Butterfly
 </pre>
 This assumes that the model given by the specified class name has a director
 named "director" with a parameter named "iterations".  If more than
 one model is given on the command line, then the parameter values will
 be set for all models that have such a parameter.
 <p>
 This class keeps count the number of open windows.  The waitForFinish
 method can then be used to determine when all of the windows opened by
 this class have been closed.  The main() method exits the application
 when all windows have been closed.
