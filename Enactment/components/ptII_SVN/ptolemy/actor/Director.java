//// Director

/**
 A Director governs the execution within a CompositeActor.  A composite actor
 that contains a director is said to be <i>opaque</i>, and the execution model
 within the composite actor is determined by the contained director.   This
 director is called the <i>local director</i> of a composite actor.
 A composite actor is also aware of the director of its container,
 which is referred to as its <i>executive director</i>.
 A director may also be contained by a CompositeEntity that is not a
 CompositeActor, in which case it acts like any other entity within
 that composite.
 <p>
 A top-level composite actor is generally associated with a <i>manager</i>
 as well as a local director.  The Manager has overall responsibility for
 executing the application, and is often associated with a GUI.   Top-level
 composite actors have no executive director and getExecutiveDirector() will
 return null.
 <p>
 A local director is responsible for invoking the actors contained by the
 composite.  If there is no local director, then the executive director
 is given the responsibility.  The getDirector() method of CompositeActor,
 therefore, returns the local director, if there is one, and otherwise
 returns the executive director.  Thus, it returns whichever director
 is responsible for executing the contained actors, or null if there is none.
 Whatever it returns is called simply the <i>director</i> (vs. local
 director or executive director).
 <p>
 A director implements the action methods (preinitialize(),
 initialize(), prefire(), fire(), postfire(), iterate(),
 and wrapup()).  In this base class, default implementations
 are provided that may or may not be useful in specific domains.   In general,
 these methods will perform domain-dependent actions, and then call the
 respective methods in all contained actors.
 <p>
 The director also provides methods to optimize the iteration portion of an
 execution. This is done by setting the workspace to be read-only during
 an iteration. In this base class, the default implementation results in
 a read/write workspace. Derived classes (e.g. domain specific
 directors) should override the _writeAccessRequired() method to report
 that write access is not required. If none of the directors in a simulation
 require write access, then it is safe to set the workspace to be read-only,
 which will result in faster execution.
