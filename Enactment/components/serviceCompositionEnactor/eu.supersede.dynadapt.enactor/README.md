## Service Composition Enactor

- (Service Composition) Enactor: The Enactor component receives the adapted system model@runtime and computes the platform specific artifacts, out of this model, to enact the changes proposed in the model. More precisely, this component provides the automatic transformation of the adapted model@runtime (e.g. a UML activity diagram) into code, that represents the service compositions to be enacted using the adaptation hooks.  

See deliverable D4.5 in [Supersede Portal](https://www.supersede.eu/) for more details about this component, how to install and use it.
