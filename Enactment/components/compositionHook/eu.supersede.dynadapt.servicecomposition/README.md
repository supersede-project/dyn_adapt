## Composition Hook - Service Composition

- (Composition) Adaptation Hook: The adaptation hook offers a generic interface, embeddable into adaptive systems, that enables the enactment of adaptation actions into the adaptable systems, provided that they adheres to the SUPERSEDE Adaptable System Architecture. This architecture requires supported adaptive systems to expose services that implement the Adaptation Hook API and apply received platform-specific adaptation actions. 

eu.supersede.dynadapt.servicecomposition project enables the application of the required adaptations into the system by providing the REST service implementation. It also supports the execution of the transformations between the services that is required for the service composition. 

See deliverable D4.5 in [Supersede Portal](https://www.supersede.eu/) for more details about this component, how to install and use it.
