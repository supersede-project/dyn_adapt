## Adaptability DSL and editor based on AOM for Dynamic Adaptation and Personalization Enactment

This editor is used by end-users to associate system variant models to variability configurations and describe the way variant models can be injected into the system model@runtime. This information is collected into adaptability models, which are document instances of the Aspect Oriented Modeling (AOM) based domain specific language (DSL) defined by SUPERSEDE.

See deliverable D4.5 in [Supersede Portal](https://www.supersede.eu/) for more details about this DSL, how to install and use it.
