## Feature Serializer

**Feature Serializer** transforms the feature model into a grammar representation required by the optimization algorithm to support automatic reasoning. It also extracts and serializes the quality and constraint attributes in separate input models

See deliverable D3.6 in [Supersede Portal](https://www.supersede.eu/) for more details about this component, how to install and use it.
