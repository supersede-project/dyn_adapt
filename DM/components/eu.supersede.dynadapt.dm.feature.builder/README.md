## Feature Model Builder

**Feature Configuration Builder** transforms the optimization algorithm outputs (e.g. a list of IDs corresponding to the selected features for the complete feature configuration) into a YAFMT feature configuration, which is the output of this component, as required by the Dynamic Adaptation Enactment platform (see deliverable D4.5 in [Supersede Portal](https://www.supersede.eu/))

See deliverable D3.6 in [Supersede Portal](https://www.supersede.eu/) for more details about this component, how to install and use it.
